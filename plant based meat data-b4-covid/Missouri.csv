2019,There’s way more at steak (see how I did that?) than just meat production. Think of all the feed (corn) that isn’t needed for plant-based burgers. And all the meat packing that isn’t needed. And. And. And. https://t.co/bLO9dskwbD
2019,Recently tried the Impossible Whopper from Burger King and thought it was tasty! Definitely a great alternative for those transitioning from eating meat to eating plant-based. Curious to see how this law suit will end https://t.co/zuUHr4pL5s
2019,"When your vegetarian daughter comes home for the weekend - plant based taco meat ❤️ Using aldiusa ground plant protein! 10 total carbs, 2 net carbs per serving. We’ll see how _jillie17 likes it 😉 #keto #ketogenic… https://t.co/5bhGYjAfN5"
2019,"https://t.co/YB09nRztsE; I always like facts.  Meat is good for you and it doesn’t cause climate change.   And, plant based burgers have more calories and sodium.  Get the facts.  @CoryBooker maybe you should read this."
2019,“Think Beyond what you thought a burger could be.” Beyond Burger plant based products at #612kitchenandcocktails. Beyond “meat” served on a bun with chipotle ranch. Choice of chips or fries. #beyondburger #plantbased #meatless https://t.co/KDyzzi1kNM
2019,but overall slutty vegan is so good everyone needs to go there and get you some plant based meat https://t.co/GBYSqZ4n8Z
2019,Starting next month @SUBWAY is going to start selling meatless meatball subs because they wanted to jump on the trend of using plant based meat. I’m intrigued. What will happen next?
2019,"“...words are needed to convey meaning to consumers beyond just animal content.  Using the word ground “meat” tells me something about how the food is expected to be cooked and served...In this instance, using “meat” with “plant-based” is helpful to the consumer insofar...” https://t.co/vZQJCaTFhS"
2019,"@pdqbach55 TBD...We’ll find out if the “Stabilization Policies Plus” (crop insurance, pp extras, MFP, etc) stabilize the situation for now.  Plant based meat acceptance is a big wild card, too..."
2019,"""I’ve heard that meat production is harming the ozone. I do believe it but I still eat meat. I’m just trying to eat a more balanced diet by shifting to more plant-based protein."" #AAA19 consumer panelist"
2019,"Since we love all things sausage, we’re rolling out an exciting new alternative to our traditional German menu offerings: #vegan brats! Made by the @theherbivorousb, this plant-based, protein-rich meat alternative was promoted by @veglifekc during our @kcoktoberfest in 2018. https://t.co/pmriJjy6Sp"
2019,"@the1travisb @sippinbey @MykeReeves @Complex The only supplement that a vegan should need (assuming a whole plant-based diet) is B12. Most meat-eaters are also B12 deficient too and should also supplement. Other than that, I also take iron supplements but I struggled with anemia before cutting out meat."
2018,"Plant-based meat, plant-based milk, and many more... will bring revolution to our food system and give us a more sustainable future. Glad I am part of that effort at @BensonHillBio with great scientists. https://t.co/nCKJHiHcq4"
2018,"@issanye It’s a plant based burger, it’s a substitute that kinda taste like meat"
2018,you are NOT plant based if you eat meat don’t @ me
2018,"@X_Confucius “However, plant-based eating isn't just about the addition of whole, plant foods such as fruits, veggies, legumes, grains, nuts and seeds, but also the elimination of ALL animal products including meat, fish, eggs, dairy, gelatin and other animal byproducts from one's diet.”"
2018,"@thelonewclf @megsawad @soybeanqueenn When you buy meat and dairy you support a money hungry, greedy, selfish industry that does not give a shit about you. Eating a whole food plant-based diet is the best thing and easiest thing anyone can do to be less harmful for all beings, included ourselves, earth, and others."
2016,@theMagggie plant based meat? Does it taste like the real thing?
2016,I think we are going to try 90% plant based diet. No more dairy and very little meat. No cancer for me.
2013,Zoners following a plant-based diet will love our meat/dairy-free pizza. http://t.co/kyS2NYxiH5
