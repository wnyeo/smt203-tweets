2019,"@pressed4thyme @SuckANik @king_dick3 @ItsFatimaG @milkmyoats @rootedwithsoul You're confusing veganism with plant-based.

Veganism is the ethical stance that it is immoral to exploit animals.  Plant based simply means the person chooses not to eat meat for any number of reasons. 

Veganism includes a plant-based diet, but goes far beyond that."

2019,Imma say it again but eating meat isn’t plant based. Not everyone goes vegan for their health. Some (like myself) go vegan to save animals.
