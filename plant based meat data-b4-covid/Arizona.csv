2019,"Wow! @BeyondMeat hit it out of the park with this one! A great way to integrate plant-based protein in more traditional, and flavorful ways! I think it’s spot on to target the non-vegan demographic in this way, to help us all reduce our red meat intake! @dunkindonuts https://t.co/7tLOvWgVii"
2019,"I think it’s interesting red meat can’t have dyes to affect color or things to mask odors, but because regulated through different agency this is fairly conversation on plant-based side🤔.

2019,"@Alyssa_Milano If #climatechange won't make you reduce your meat consumption then maybe this will. You should check out your supermarket meat freezers today, suddenly plant based meats such as Beyond Meats, Impossible Foods and more are now readily available. Give 'em a try!"
