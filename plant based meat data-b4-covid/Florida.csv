2019,@venusin12th @cashewbeans @yungspartak I was vegan 🌱 once and it didn’t work for my body because my body needs meat sadly. You can eat plant based without being a dick. also when I was vegan I was BUDGETING! even with the $10 in my account rn. Please give me a meal plan idea based on a vegan diet that’s doable.
2019,"It bugs me when people think that the way to be “healthier” is to go gluten-free, meat free, or with highly processed “plant based” food. Everyone’s diets and needs are different. What works for one person doesn’t always work for another."

Just to irk vegans."
2019,"@NanciGuestRDPhD Uh wrong. If you don’t eat skeletal muscle, you’re a vegan. Someone that eats meat, but mostly plants, eats a plant-based diet."
2019,@runnergirladams @NanciGuestRDPhD @ShawnArent @kevinnbass @UofSCSportSci Virtually every meat-eating athlete I know eats a plant-based diet. Rice is 1/4 of my entire diet. Meat and plant-based (however defined) are not mutually exclusive.

2019,"@MagazineRange Drovers should quit calling it plant based. It's a euphemism for vegan. The ARs &amp; vegan meat companies knew normal people wouldn't buy ""vegan"" food. So they gave it a nicer non offensive name &amp; blasted it so everyone would change. 
Don't get used. Call it vegan--turn ppl off."

2019,@SieJ24 I agree with that side of it. But I feel like lab grown meat won’t have any of the health advantages that plant based provides. Better for the environment but not necessarily better for humans
2019,@always_GoHARDER It’s not necessarily bad but getting your food off a plant based diet is better than any meat.. fish are used as a healthy alternative to chicken and beef bc they have good protein and low fat.. but crabs/crustaceans normally have a lot of cholesterol..
2019,"@MagazineRange U mean her vegan diet, right?
Just bc she calls it plant based doesn't mean u have to. 
That new name 4 vegan came from the food cos &amp; Animal Rightist trying 2 lure normal people in2 buying vegan meat. Anything vegan is a turnoff so they changed the name.
Don't help them."

2019,"@VeganAri Any opportunity to expand plant-based alternatives for the mass public is a good thing. It is substituting meat, why would a Vegan have a problem with that? Particularly with a brand that is global reaching millions of people who otherwise don’t even know what the “vegan” means!"
