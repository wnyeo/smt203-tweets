2019,"@microbear1 @liluzitwerq @hoglorfen @jigglypuffgrl @dearnonnatives @Lollardfish Hi I’m a Utahn, no tribes were plant based here. Also I’m Mexican, Mayans and Aztec people still exist and definitely eat meat"

2019,@lildumbassseal honestly there are so many great meat substitutes that you can cook your favorite meals with. beyond meat is an awesome plant based no soy protein source and i also use gardinia a lot! pretty much any recipe can be modified and made vegan :-)
2019,"Plant based flavored meat is going to be popping up more and more, I'm wondering how many vegetarians want this? Is this a thing for you, or is it meat eaters that are trying to get away from red meat?"
2019,"Do-NOT mistake these for your average doughnut! We were fooled into thinking the Maple Bacon Bar had meat and butter in it, but alas, it was 100% plant-based! We'll sign up to be April… https://t.co/9v6g23yuSt"
2019,"@amyythevegan Meat: Gardein, Tofurkey, Beyond meat, Field roast 
Cheese: Diaya, Chao, Vio life (my personal fave), Miyokos 
Milk: Silk brand has soy, cashew, coconut, almond etc. you can find many brands of plant based milk in almost every store.
