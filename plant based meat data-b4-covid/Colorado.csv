2019,"Bold idea: Instead of harming the human digestive system that has thrived on meat for a half million years or so with a risky vegan diet, we actually teach the grey wolves to live on plant-based diets through a rigorous government-mandated retraining program? Solved. #copolitics https://t.co/hZ05SxkmcX"
2019,"@CryptoRanger1 @Grimhood I’m not American but okay. And yes, I did eat very high quality meat, I have only eaten organic and free range my whole life and I caught my own fish. I found murdering animals wrong and decided to make a switch to eat plant based and I have never felt better."
2019,@InnocentCitzen @DoreldaDoremus @BurgerKing I shouldn't have to. It stands to reason that if Burger King is advertising a plant based burger; they shouldn't be cooking it on a meat grill.
2019,@yumyumproduceee @BurgerKing Animal products will kill you too; they inject them with so many hormones and antibiotics now and it gets into the meat. Plant based is better and no animals suffer the cruelty of factory farming. #BanFactoryFarming https://t.co/cVMbJCGXB3
2019,Tried plant based keto for a couple of weeks. Lost my travel weight but this week my morning heart rate is above 50 and I had no gas on the bike today. Not good with a race coming up. Going to go back to keto with ethically raised meat. #NSNG #LCHF
2019,"Watched @gcmovie last night on @netflix. As an athlete and someone who competes, it really makes me step back and look at my meat consumption and really look into the power that a plant-based lifestyle offers 👌🏻 #TheGameChangers"
2019,"Faust tried a bit of that impossible plant based meat stuff and liked it, then burped and said ""hey it doesn't taste terrible coming up either!"""
2019,"""aight so hear me out. what if for our plant based meat ... we just put plants IN the meat??"""
2019,@gayershot @grandcrossomega @_almakarma It is not a black bean patty. It’s a fully plant based protein “meat replacement”.
2019,"Arby's, I haven't seen such forward thinking since Woolworths 

Food &amp; Wine: Arby’s Says It Will Never Add Plant-Based Meat to Its Menu.

2019,"i keep that juicy, juicy. i eat that (plant based) lunch meat 😘"
2019,"@cat_knapps So for example: if i go to a cafe that offers vegan products, I’m creating more of a demand for it, so if it’s a popular plant based place they eventually start spending less on meat/dairy - more on plant based foods! In the long run it slows down the demand with the big guys! 😊"
2019,@cat_knapps Just the diet itself! When more people become plant based it creates less demand for dairy/meat products! Reducing the stuff that goes into ozone and the ocean (animal by products have run offs that spill into our natural waters) 😊
2019,"@vegan_vexation @kmf_art Not to mention, some people choose a plant based lifestyle for environmental reasons vs. ""Meat is murder"" reasons so like?? It doesn't always have to be one side against another."
2019,"Day 5: First day I've felt some improvement since starting whole food plant based diet. Staying away from meat isn't too difficult, but staying away from dairy is."
