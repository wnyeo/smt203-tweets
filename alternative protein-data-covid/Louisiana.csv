2021,"@Cornfrmr It's really more alternative as opposed to ""fake"". Fake is a term used by those who don't like change or something different. IMO. I am not a vegetarian, however I am very interested in producing protein anyway we can in less footprint more sustainable way."
2021,"@RadioRodThorson @Kimbrellfarms06 I'm bullish alternative protein.  I believe we have a protein problem. Not a cow, pig or chicken problem. There is a big difference. The mistake many in traditional agriculture make is they assume it has to start with a cow as opposed to a first principles clean slate solution."
2021,"this might be an unpopular opinion, but if your “meat alternative” isn’t a decent source of protein than it’s not a great alternative 

just please give me more than 2 grams of protein in your “vegan meats” 🥴"
2020,I made protein coffee following @FitWithMarilyn recipe and I’ve found a healthy alternative to keep my coffee and get my protein 🙌🏽
