2021,It’s disheartening to read an announcement that a former Iowa Secretary of Ag is affiliated w/ an organization that is focused on the development of plant-based &amp; cell-cultured ‘alternative’ protein sources.
2020,"This is the same Kamala Harris that wants the government to offer incentives &amp; adjust dietary guidelines to reduce the consumption of red meat. 

Do you suppose alternative protein products, aka ‘fake meat,’ were served?
