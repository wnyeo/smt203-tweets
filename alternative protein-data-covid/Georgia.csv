2020,@booshahhh LMAOOO well Iâ€™m glad you have an alternative!! Iâ€™ve found really good coffee flavored protein if you wanna give that a shot!
2020,@dezinpub I started taking a vitamin when all this began. Wanted a stronger immune system. Side benefit has been more energy. But I get needing protein. I get weak feeling without it. Peanut butter toast with honey is a nice alternative if youâ€™re not up for cooking. Or eggs?
