2021,"@WORLDN0MAD No. Problem is its being forced upon us as 'healthier ethical' alternative to humans' ultimate nutrition: animal protein. Its neither. It could however make its billionaire investors massive profits if real meat is outlawed, because ethical, regenerative farming won't make £$€."
2021,"Thank you @wetheclimate for a great story about the positive impact of @HargolFoodTech grasshoppers as an alternative protein source!

2021,#Evolution: Tail loss in apes was mediated by intonic insertion of an Alu in the TBXT gene leading to alternative splicing and deletion of a protein-coding exon. A most elegant study revealing yet again the inelegance of evolutionary pathways. https://t.co/78fxnyyJwb @ItaiYanai https://t.co/1VOEXtQPwq
2021,"@AmandaLeftCoast I believe that they produce different versions of the spike protein that present different antigens. I know that Scott Gottlieb’s book talks about the development of the Pfizer vaxx, and the alternative versions they tried before settling on one."
2021,"THEIR OPTION 
Get some incomplete, non-bioavailable protein with a load of antinutrients

ALTERNATIVE
Drink a quality grass fed whey product with (possibly) no other ingredients 

EVEN BETTER
Eat a 🥩

Keep it simple, guys 🤷‍♂️ https://t.co/wziv3swAcu"

2021,@Dustin_And3rson Breakfast protein shake can be a good alternative.  Less then 300 calories also.  I find they are workable.   Not bacon and eggs with pancakes and biscuits for sure.

2020,"@Zerohourprophet @JSmoothHD You could tell yourself Nutty Buddy's have protein from the peanut butter &amp; caffeine from the chocolate, so they are a great pick me up snack &amp; protein bar alternative. 😅"
2020,Whoever said “Protein Shakes” are a good alternative for breakfast is a liar. There are no good alternatives #HappyTuesday #servingSAISD2020
2020,So Beyond Meat’s Beyond Beef taste wayyy better than the Target brand Good &amp; Gather Alternative Protein Ground.
2020,"@egirlprivilege the egg is there for it’s protein content, when it cooked it’s forms long amino acid chains that hold the gnocchi together. I would look to vegan pasta recipes for alternative binders"
2020,"@tednaiman @MonicaRicci @DrSeanOMara @DrHorwitz I seem to have some issues with dairy. So looking for alternative protein powder other than whey, to up P:E ratios. Just for convenience.   Suggestions? Thoughts?"
