2021,"I don't know if it's an Autistic thing, or an eating disorder thing, or both, but it's often nearly impossible for me to make myself eat food that wasn't what I wanted/planned. It's been that way my whole life."
2021,"@libsoftiktok US/ modern culture includes foods, sports, games, religion, music, dress/fashion,tech borrowed from  many cultures. It would be virtually impossible for any American to live normally without culturally appropriating. Im white, sharing my opinion.
Correct me if wrong."
2021,It‚Äôs like impossible to get fast food fast now
2021,I really appreciate that Impossible Foods is starting to work on Impossible Chicken Nuggets but the big question is when will we be able to get them in the shape of dinosaurs?
2021,"Look, I'm a nerd, I will always think that books are the greatest gift you can ever offer to anyone. In second place is food and Teh offered both to Oh-Aew.  So... yeah, he completely got me there. Books, food and free classes! How not to fall in love? That's impossible!üçµüå∫üåÑ https://t.co/hNrRhlADjb"
2021,@EricTheUmpire agreed. $IPOD = Impossible Foods.
2021,"@pretend_freedom I did experiment with garlic years ago, had fever for 2-3 weeks non stop and intense headaches, soon learnt pranic food,over stimulation,herbal detox etc, but a friend of mine brought a gone vision back via garlic and gingko biloba,medically labeled impossible!"
2021,"@aruni_t If someone would like to watch, Restaurant: Impossible is also great! It shows how restaurants have to profit off some of the cheap food options such as pasta etc. while profit margins from high end products are low. IOW, profit% is not the same all across. That's 101."
2021,"@TrishaMomOf6 Well, if they implied co-morbidities and food in those restaurants gives people food poisoning - its not an entirely impossible number..."
2021,"@Y_Soup I'd concentrate on mostly whole foods, but the occasional impossible burger or whatever is fine IMO.

Nuts are a great source of fats, and beans and lentils are a great source of protein. Seasoning things will help as well (meat by itself doesn't actually taste good, for example)"
2021,"@latimes What is stopping us is a political and economic system that sees all human dignity and need as a commodity. If we had a citizen and worker-owned economic system, this crisis lifestyle would be impossible to continue. Food for thought."
2021,$bynd why the pop and then drop? A while back there were rumors of an Impossible Foods SPAC at $10 bil. So ppl may be reading this $7 bil valuation as a disappointment. Not enough info to judge though in my opinion 1/2 https://t.co/9h9MuOJHUs
2021,"i love pigging out. eat slowly and enjoy my food? impossible, because i enjoy food the most when i pig out on it."
2021,@veganhippiesol Impossible tastes just like fast food. Prefer gardein or Morningstar. The spicy alpha nuggets are great
2021,"@LochlinCross twist on this topic, i experience ghost smells? things like perfume or foods from childhood, i suddenly smell, in places those odors should be impossible"
2021,shopping for the right products is sometimes impossible. Those traveling for leisure or business in unfamiliar territories find sourcing vegan food especially challenging. They‚Äôre often limited to basic foods like salads and bread for long periods. 3/5
2021,"&amp; car notes, insurance, food, other bills, &amp; I mean nigga gotta put something up to stack. It seems  impossible You really gotta hustle fr . One job ain‚Äôt enough, fuck two ain‚Äôt enough I‚Äôm working hard so my money can work for me shit just take time, patience, understanding https://t.co/O5xDaThwz1"
2021,"@Rothmus It‚Äôs my favorite fast food place for a veggie burger as an Indian vegetarian, good to know Its white shoremwfiet. Every other burger joint serves a sad ass black bean patty or impossible patty which I don‚Äôt like."
2021,Mission impossible: find ice cream at fast food place in STL starring me :(
2021,"Many refugees have faced impossible struggles and food insecurity has been a reality for too many.

We‚Äôre supporting them to ensure refugees going without proper nutrition is a thing of the past. #GlobalGoals #FoodSystems4SDGs
#refugees 
#UNHCR https://t.co/0cpLlxoSmt"
2021,"@rmayemsinger @MrJonCryer @innoutburger Smh, it's not impossible for those customers to get food... might not be exactly how they wanted it, but that's the risk of eating in n out."
2021,"It is absolutely amazing how fiat our food options and supply chains have become. It‚Äôs nearly impossible to find high quality foods at restaurants, especially on the go. $20 for tiny burger patty between two MASSIVE pieces of bread and plate piled with fries. #fiatfooddesert"
2021,"@sh_megan It‚Äôs nearly impossible to always avoid all the junk in our food in this country. You just gotta do your best to reduce your overall toxic load and choose your battles wisely. I‚Äôll still have cookies or ice cream occasionally, I just make sure it‚Äôs made of real, whole ingredients."
2021,"@starless941 @nightowlnomore an impossible purity test, for hungry people. Eat this food on our terms, that's what chopsticks repreesent. Do it skillfully for long enough, and maybe, MAYBE your host will drink the broth, you filthy commoner. Then and only then may you partake"
2021,"Our inalienable rights - life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness - are impossible without...

üö∞ Clean water

There is no justice without environmental justice."
2021,"Interested in SpaceX, stripe, triller, Rubrik, Impossible Foods ect? DM I have a plug for those and about 20 more. No üß¢ #Ad #StocksToBuy #family"
2021,"@anglissima @audrawelling2 @colgraphics @wil_da_beast630 As I understand it, hell is as hot as flames, which means that rotting is impossible. It is above what we in the food industry call the danger zone for microbial growth. Anything above 130 would cause desiccation, not rotting"
2021,"@MdRisette @gorskon @NeilWilmerding @ccbadchap Well in all seriousness, it's impossible to eat foods like that ""in moderation"".  Which is something the food companies know all too well, and profit from immensely."
2021,@wavemaker65 @AnnaStolarska9 Also not a coincidence PP is across the street at two Impossible Foods locations in Industrial parks. Don't think for a minute they wouldn't supply left over parts for processing in our food.
2021,"I've already talked about this some months ago, but its never late to remember that she even dropped the food in the floor üòÇ
Impossible not to love Leafa üíö https://t.co/t6B5e9iZHl https://t.co/gSU08pYKTF"
2021,"@ratman720 We would never use any life-saving drug using your criteria.  If there is small evidence of harm, and lots of evidence of benefit, they get approved.  Your standards are Impossible Expectations, that is never used in practice. 

Every medicine, or food has risks."
2021,"The Storm, in an apparent quest to make life difficult for the visually impaired, have jerseys tonight in which the numbers are nearly impossible to read. At least they are sponsored by a quality fast food franchise https://t.co/P8KAUYWheb"
2021,"@pizzahut 

I want a entire refund. The fact that calling a a Pizza Hut and speaking with someone is impossible. The HORRIBLE experience/food I received today was DISGUSTING!!! I want allll of my money back!"
2021,"@chaoticgaythey take a month off quarterly to vacation somewhere impossible to properly do in a shorter amount of time. Italy, Japan, Central America, India... hell, you could just devote a month to doing a culinary tour of everything from street food to fine dining, probably"
2021,"@ms_thurmond The food, my neighborhood, Downtown Omaha, the outdoorsy options"
2021,"(for those unaware, a comet destroyed literally all of my most difficult to construct buildings in the early game, where my opponents already have an edge, *plus* it corrupted all the surrounding land making growing food to grow a defensive force impossible- this is game ending)"
2021,"@JackBox is now offering @ImpossibleFoods Impossible #Burgers at its Phoenix, AZ locations, until 12/12/21. üçî It‚Äôs the first fast-food chain to offer a plant-based patty in place of meat in items on its core menu. üçî #MeatlessMonday https://t.co/JmSCL61BX4"
2021,"@regandarcy @DanPriceSeattle @JesseLaGreca UBI is a reasonable concept. Independent restaurants find it impossible to compete with high volume food chains w/volume discounts &amp; automation that drives down prices. Margins are small in food biz. If they raise prices &amp; customers aren't making more, they'll lose customers."
2021,"@RegalKingNeo @VinceCoglianese @RealCandaceO Communism is just like a native community collectively sharing their homes, food, etc. with each other and not claiming ownership of their land or property, and working towards the common good.

Scaling that up seems unlikely, if not impossible."
2021,"@pipandbaby @hoggomcswineass When the whole ‚ÄúImpossible‚Äù/‚ÄúBeyond‚Äù pseudo-meat craze was being hyped a year or two ago, I predicted (here, IIRC) that it would all dwindle to a tiny niche w/in a few years &amp; that the # of fast food offerings would shrink. https://t.co/a1y2Kp03qC"
2021,"Why? 

When most of us get bored, we feed our brains mental fast food: distraction on phones/laptops/etc. 

This makes focus impossible, because our brain is constantly begging for more McDonalds. 

Boredom bypasses the drive through and trains new patterns."
2021,@GoLongNotShort @JoeHarper @AmericanOnline0 @JPeccedi @ExcaliburTrade first play we did on this was when $IPOF = Discord. Second time I believe was $IPOF = Impossible Foods. Then today was $IPOF = SpaceX. i'll try to think of a new one.
