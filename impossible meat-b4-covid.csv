2019,I got a sous vide for xmas but we don't eat a lot of meat anymore so now I'm wondering if you can make an Impossible Burger with a sous vide.
2019,Tried an impossible Whopper today... Close but I could tell it was different from real meat. Not bad but probably not a regular for me. #Food #burgerking @ Burger King https://t.co/I0sV8Jvy4D
2019,@SirTitan45 @JavaMonster Nobody really wants them. The impossible burger has only increased  4% in sales at Burger King. While REAL meat burgers have also increased.
2019,I don't get why Burger King asks if I want cheese or bacon on my Impossible Whopper.  Uh no. There's a reason I'm eating plant based meat ya goofs.
2019,Just tried ‚Äúimpossible wings‚Äù and came to the shocking realization that I like fake meat more than real meat. ü•∫
