2019,"Read @CenterForBioDiv’s endorsement of plant-based products such as @ImpossibleFoods and @BeyondMeat for their contribution to a global shift towards a plant-forward diet. Thank you, @KieranSuckling!

2019,@SnoopDogg @dunkindonuts @BeyondMeat Tim Hortons been on this. It's actually not that bad
2019,🖤🖤 @BeyondMeat https://t.co/ggZ0BH4dhL
2019,I sent @BeyondMeat an email requesting this change on 16 June 2019. This is very exciting!!!
2019,"When a company takes sunflower oil out of their products a few months after you write to them! Seaux happy! @BeyondMeat I can enjoy a climate-friendly, allergy-safe burger experience with my family!!! (I’m catastrophically allergic to sunflower). https://t.co/lbK5A1fVbc"
2019,about to make meatless spaghetti ft. beyond meat &amp; banza chickpea pasta 👀

2019,"@jgrano305 @rick_scinta @ImpossibleFoods @BeyondMeat Yes, definitely."
2019,"Plant-based foods continue to march into fast food: KFC’s plant-based chicken, from @BeyondMeat, sold out in a few hours https://t.co/upv6IK44y7 Typical new strategy statement: KFC isn’t targeting vegans. “Our target customers for this product are ‘flexitarians’”"
2019,@SarahKSilverman @CarlsJr @BeyondMeat Same with Burger King
2019,@Etoyrakue1 @kfc @BeyondMeat @PandaExpress @BurgerKing @Wendys @tacobell @DairyQueen Okay that’s true!!! I’m still team spicy potato taco forever tho 😂
2019,"@Etoyrakue1 @kfc @BeyondMeat @PandaExpress @BurgerKing @Wendys @tacobell @DairyQueen Taco Bell is actually pretty veggie friendly! You can get the spicy potato taco, bean burrito, or do a bowl (black beans, rice, pico, veggies, salsa). Also, if I’m not mistaken you can order any of the menu items (for example a chalupa) &amp; have them replace meat with black beans!"
2019,@kfc @BeyondMeat In case you may have thought to yourself for a brief moment that this would be a healthy alternative.. I am here to tell you no Sir/Ma’am
2019,@PaleTanner As far as seasonings almost all of them are vegan friendly so you just use that shit on replacement products to recreate your fave tastes!! I.e. @ChefPaul_Magic Meat Magic on a @BeyondMeat burger
2019,I ain’t tryna be a vegan or anything but that beyond meat taste good.

2019,"@fuuuckkatie Make a regular gumbo and use vegan products honestly, you can add chickpeas, you can sub sausage with vegan sausage (beyond meat has really good stuff) 
The roux itself is vegan cause it’s just flour, so vegan gumbo is actually really simple!"
2019,@BeyondMeat When are you going to eliminate canola oil? Surely you know the highly-processed polyunsaturated fatty acids in this industrial seed oil fuel inflammation.
