Look at how much water it takes for one pound of meat.
  If I can do it, I was raised on fried chicken, roast, pork, anyone can do it. 
7 years no meat.

2019,@pop_popculture @BeyondMeat @SUBWAY @BurgerKing @ImpossibleFoods No argument here
2019,@pop_popculture @BeyondMeat @SUBWAY I mean the veggie patty isn’t terrible if you drown it in sweet onion and chipotle. Sounds bad. But isn’t
2019,"@BeyondMeat @SUBWAY Some of those are truly oddball locations where I’d kind of expect the pilot to fail. Is the thought that if this can succeed in those spots, it’ll work most places?"

2019,KFC is coming out with a bucket of beyond meat fried chicken and that to me is wildly awesome.
2019,@Kenners__ @Earth_Burger @BeyondMeat This is amazing
2019,@DavidMajerowski @yashar No way for many reasons- beyond meat&amp; cheese together.
2019,Good news - @MinskysPizza now has @BeyondMeat for burgers and as a pizza topping! https://t.co/BbhdWmYrGH
2019,@GaryKaltbaum @BullsBearsFBN @JonathanHoenig @lizpeek Yep! Beyond Meat has too much money! It must cause cancer.
2019,beyond meat is better than impossible meat and that’s that
2019,@pizzacrustina We have a beyond meat factory in Columbia so just come back here!
2019,"@30to50feralhog1 @CarlsJr @BeyondMeat @ImpossibleFoods Did you catch the Impossible Whopper? FWIW, I prefer beyond but they are both great products"
2019,@WarriorClayton1 @CarlsJr @BeyondMeat https://t.co/8skkzPdVL1
2019,@devonjerimiah @CarlsJr @BeyondMeat Soooooo… Just hormone and antibiotic filled meat for you then?
2019,@BurgerDogBoy @CarlsJr @BeyondMeat @Hardees No ☹️
2019,@SL_Rhodes_ @CarlsJr @BeyondMeat No. Hardee’s is too busy mocking plant based folks with their terrible “save the veggies” marketing campaign. Hard to reconcile that this is the same company
2019,"@jonk @solitarybrother While I haven’t had the CJ burger yet, I am super acquainted w/ BeyondMeat and I have to agree while both are awesome, beyond edges out the competition. ALSO SEE: More substantial"
2019,Picky eater? Not a fan of veggies like.... at all? Y’all need to try the beyond meat burgers. They are amazing and probably what I’ll be living on for a while
2019,Guys look what aldiusa has this week! @beyondmeat burgers!! I couldn’t believe it! I bought them all Lol. They also have turkey breakfast sausage for once. I wish they had that all the time for our fave breakfast… https://t.co/jKVhXVPAtM
2019,"@graysonottaway @thatjohn @bnickeson @AirlineFlyer @WhiteCastle They are quite good actually. I prefer Beyond meat though. I’ve been a Vegetarian for over a decade, both products are almost too real. It’s weird."
2019,Enjoyed my first @BeyondMeat sandwich at @harposkc #delicious
2019,We heard @awrestaurants had @BeyondMeat stuff. @JillianMarisa and I went to investigate. Drive-thru lady was super confused. Must not be nationwide yet. 🤷🏻‍♂️
2019,@WolfCarnivore @ImpossibleFoods @BeyondMeat @neilhimself Absolutely.
2019,@flylabrock Thanks to @BeyondMeat I got to do the same this week. So awesome!
2019,This is hilarious- @Arbys trying to differentiate itself from the @BeyondMeat craze by making vegetables out of meat https://t.co/89rSYig6Hb
2019,@ohhleary @BeyondMeat I’d do it
2019,"@ohhleary @user47 @BeyondMeat I pad $8.99 for 4 yesterday at the grocery store. 

For ballpark food though, that’s not terrible."
2019,"@ohhleary @BeyondMeat Oh boy, I bet that set you back a pretty penny!"
2019,Last night I grilled up @BeyondMeat burgers and brauts. So good 😍. First braut in easily 20 years. I wish I had taken pictures. https://t.co/ST2sG8bx05
2019,@BlackBovine @Hardees @BeyondMeat ALSO: apparently Wall Street agrees. I’ve nearly doubled my money in less than 90 days. 😉 https://t.co/65C48o4uWO
2019,@BlackBovine @Hardees @BeyondMeat https://t.co/81DprPU86B
2019,@BeyondMeat Of course you do know that there are animals who were put on this earth to nourish our bodies cows pigs deer and so on. Those put here to be our companions dogs cats &amp; horses and predators who were put here to help humans control animal populations like deer turkey  and much more
2019,"@bandit5160 @Hardees @BeyondMeat Agreed. Thanks for respectful discourse. Also, for what it’s worth, Carl’s Jr. (who own Hardee’s) have abeyond burger. But I get it, Hardee’s is in a geographic region less quick to adapt."

2019,@BeltwayBeef @MarkNel1026 @BeefUSA We just want to feel like you are fighting like hell for us!! Doesn’t have to be rational. We are getting our asses kicked. It’s flipping beef month and beyond meat IPO’s that’s a slap face.

2019,@gpfunk69 @GregoryNg @Hardees @BeyondMeat You have an interesting perspective. Off the menu in two weeks? @BeyondMeat just had their IPO this week. Their stock shot up 160% *in one day.* The market says you have no idea what you are talking about.
2019,"In all of the excitement with work I failed to finish up my inclusion in the @BeyondMeat $BYND IPO. Sure am kicking myself… It’s up over 125% just for the day. Ughhhhhh. Buy high, I guess ☹️"
2019,"@Michael16769244 @Hardees @BeyondMeat Carry on, Michael https://t.co/UDCdAZGRtx"
2019,@GregoryNg @Hardees @BeyondMeat Fair enough. Good banter. Seems worth noting BurgerKing tested their impossible burger here in MO where White Castle also has impossible options. I think Hardee’s is making a mistake

2019,"@Hardees Three things: 
1) Stop. You are not Arby’s.
2) With few exceptions, marketing through exclusion/alienation of a potential consumer segment (one that is growing) is extremely harmful to brand.
3) Your sister brand (Carls Jr) offers  @BeyondMeat options.
