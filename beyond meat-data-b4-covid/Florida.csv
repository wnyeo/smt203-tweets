2019,@ByronMurphy8 @McDonalds @BeyondMeat I thought of that but they don't have a bacon lettuce and tomato sandwich....or they just don't need to abbreviate it.
2019,@LewTurner @BeyondMeat Yes it was delicious! I’m not just saying that. I’ve had some vegan food that tasted like a...well not very good.😬
2019,"@paul_peschiera @BeyondMeat So. The real question here.
The important, burning issue in this heated debate.
.
.
Was it yummy?"
2019,@LewTurner @BeyondMeat Well yes they do but most of those salads come with meat and/or dairy on them. You can ask to hold those items but you still pay full price for basically lettuce. I made a mistake. I had an impossible burger at Burger King in Nashville not a Beyond burger but still same idea.
2019,"@paul_peschiera @BeyondMeat I don’t eat fast food anymore. It’s been a year. But, don’t these places serve salads? Real question."
2019,@LewTurner @BeyondMeat We have to be ok with eating at restaurants that also serve meat because there are very few options and it’s good to see that we actually have some now.
2019,@LewTurner @BeyondMeat Honestly it’s because it’s giving options which was never there before. I recently has a layover in Nashville airport and that was the only option I had to get food. It’s meant as a transition food for people moving to eating vegan so make it look like a burger.
2019,"@paul_peschiera @BeyondMeat Ok. My continued issue with this is: if you’re so passionate about the issue, why patronize a business that makes the other stuff? Also, why shape it like a meat burger?"
