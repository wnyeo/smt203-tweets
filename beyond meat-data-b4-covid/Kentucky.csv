2018,"@AbraxasDerezz @BURGERFI @BeyondMeat They're excellent, and I'm not a veggie burger girl, I usually prefer my black bean burgers overall."

@BURGERFI sells @BeyondMeat burgers which is a really high class #VeggieBurger brand that actually tastes pretty good.
If you're trying the #vegetarian thing I highly #recommend giving it a shot, although you do pay a little bit more for the quality."
