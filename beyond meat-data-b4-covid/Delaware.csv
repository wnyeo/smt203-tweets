2019,"@ClaudesBBQ @BurgerKing @BeyondMeat This is literally how food companies work. They introduce new products (meat and non-meat based) and if it works they keep it and if not they discontinue and on to the next. If you’re not mad, using words such as SJW / fools / garbage can seem contradictory."

2019,"@Kaylachu Don't you get it??? If you don't hate beyond meat burgers like they do, then you disgrace their ENTIRE family tree! Silly!"
2019,@sugwrites Have you had the Beyond Meat or Impossible Burger yet? So good!
2019,@FoodLion Why did you remove @BeyondMeat Meat patties from my local store #1426?  I was told they were selling very well.  I have to drive an additional 20 mins. to purchase the patties!
2018,@Torieee_love @BeyondMeat duuuuude beyond meat is to die for 😍
2017,Fun fact beyond meat was never sold in my ShopRite. I had yo travel to Whole Foods for it. Today I picked up 2 packages from my ShopRite
2017,@BeyondMeat is the best. I just had the best vegan hamburger ever. And the best part is I didn’t have to leave home.
