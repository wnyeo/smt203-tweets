Cook @BeyondMeat as directed. Add 1 drained can of each: kidney beans, pinto beans, black beans, whole kernel corn, diced tomatoes. 
Stir in: 1 packet Hidden Valley dressing, 1 packet @oldelpaso taco seasoning. Simmer for 15 mins. Serve w/ cornbread or saltines. https://t.co/1wc6TiPRaS"
2019,@GoodVybzDEL @BeyondMeat I love Kroger sales them. I only fuck with the chickn tbh but it's legit as tf
2019,@ErikaJGlover @BeyondMeat Yea! Been wanting to experiment with this “ground beef” 😉 &amp; today it’s the perfect rainy Saturday to do it!!
2019,It’s a @BeyondMeat Chili in Crock Pot kind of day! #allthatandicancooktoo ✔️ #rainyday https://t.co/HdGAXYoeHw
2019,"@BeyondMeat @SUBWAY I tried one in KY. It was pretty tasty. Had a ""meatball"" sub on Italian with spinach, banana peppers, salt and pepper."
2019,@peta @JimmyWayne @BeyondMeat We’re all about @BeyondMeat @peta! (Also use shampoos and other products not tested on our furry friends.)
2019,@peta @BeyondMeat It’s hard to believe how good @BeyondMeat taste and minus the grease.

2019,Beyond meat is so nasty. I don’t see how y’all do that shit.
2019,@TommyCochran96 @thegeekinvegan @BeyondMeat @kfc Yeah. My wife can't have soy either. We love going to @FREEBIRDS_WB because of their availability of @BeyondMeat
2019,@thegeekinvegan @BeyondMeat @kfc Do you know if it's soy-free?
2019,"@laurindavis @JessicaMauerhan @dstockto @BeyondMeat It looks like we have one in Nashville, but it’s in Green Hills, and you can’t pay me enough to drive through there during lunch time. The traffic in that area is horrible, and there’s no way to widen the roads to alleviate the congestion."
2019,@JessicaMauerhan @dstockto @BeyondMeat What is Freebirds?
2019,"@JessicaMauerhan @BeyondMeat I listened to the @ShouldThisExist episode on @NewHarvestOrg’s lab-grown meat today. It’s interesting, but the technique currently still requires harming a cow; they’re making progress, though."
2019,@JessicaMauerhan @BeyondMeat I haven’t. Are they carried in restaurants yet?
2019,"People who know me understand I'm a beef guy. Give me the red meat. However,  I  ate a Beyond Meat burger @HueysRestaurant in Millington tonight and it was good. Really good.  

I'm both pleased and disappointed with myself at the same time."

2019,"@FREEBIRDS_WB I love that y’all have beyond meat, but hate that it’s loaded with cheap potatoes. No other Protien option on your menu had that except the one I have to pay extra for! Chipotle’s sofristas tastes amazing &amp; no added carbo fillers! It’s also one of the cheapest options."
2019,Yay! @BeyondMeat is back at @FREEBIRDS_WB https://t.co/ISck34bJBd

2019,@primetimevol @BeyondMeat @Publix Get around it @primetimevol ! BBQ at my place next time you’re in Nash 😁
2019,"I'm really glad @FREEBIRDS_WB here in Nashville has @BeyondMeat in their line. My wife is SF/GF/DF and vegetarian and it allows her to still have a great protein option. Sets them apart from all the other burrito joints. Plus, the staff at the Green Hills store are lovely."
