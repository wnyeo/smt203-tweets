2019,"@JonathanRKnight @BeyondMeat @dunkindonuts Eh... I donâ€™t love how their breakfast sandwiches PERMANENTLY have lots and lots of pepper already in the eggs. That means if DD is the only place to get sustenance for miles, and you want a breakfast sandwich so bad, you either have to choke it down or youâ€™re SHIT OUTTA LUCK!"
