2019,"@paulsmathers @DenverChannel @ImpossibleFoods @BeyondMeat Plant-based means food that comes from plants.  Guacamole. Plant based. All food is plant based. Some have meat, dairy and eggs added to them, losing the distinction of being 100% plant based."
2019,"@AustraliaThirst @DenverChannel @ImpossibleFoods @BeyondMeat The point is a majority of humans are lactose intolerant which highlights the obvious that after infancy, milk (regardless of species) is not required for nutrition. By your logic, we should be drinking dog, cat or pigs milk in addition to cow milk"
2019,"@Coyote443 @DenverChannel @ImpossibleFoods @BeyondMeat We require about 10 times more crops to feed 56 billion farmed animals per year than if only 7 billion humans ate some of those crops directly. So if we’re truly concerned with minimizing animal deaths from crop harvesting, we should be vegan."
2019,"@Duhwiggy @DenverChannel @ImpossibleFoods @BeyondMeat I’m going to have to stop eating high sodium foods such as chips, pizza, soup, canned veggies. Meanwhile you should avoid processed deli meats, shrimp, hot dogs, cheese, bacon....🙄"
2019,"@AustraliaThirst @DenverChannel @ImpossibleFoods @BeyondMeat No difference. Breast milk is only made for the species it creates it for. Besides, 65% of the worlds population is lactose intolerant. Meaning after infancy, we lack the enzymes to breakdown lactose https://t.co/hvEFJpdBUm"
2019,@paulsmathers @DenverChannel @ImpossibleFoods @BeyondMeat You are the one who claimed to never eat a plant based food. I just assumed you never picked up a piece of food that was a plant.

2019,"@meinderthobbema @mjkst27 @DenverChannel @ImpossibleFoods @BeyondMeat I don’t think you understand what a plant based diet entails. Besides meat eaters eat the same plant based diet but they believe their protein comes from a slab of meat. Everyone is truly plant based, but most just believe the lies that eating meat is healthy and normal."

2019,"@xYooper_ @DenverChannel @ImpossibleFoods @BeyondMeat Our ancestors did many things that we’d find disturbing, including killing each other, and don’t do many things we do today that improve our lives.

2019,@e_veritas_unum @DenverChannel @ImpossibleFoods @BeyondMeat We require about 10 times more crops to feed 56 billion farmed animals per year than if only 7 billion humans ate some of those crops directly. Don’t raise farm animals for meat and we can feed more people. Your argument is invalid.
2019,"@peko3417 @DenverChannel @ImpossibleFoods @BeyondMeat The vegan argument doesn’t say that veganism is right because we can’t be healthy otherwise, it merely states that given the choice of being healthy as a vegan or a non-vegan, we should choose the former since it’s more ethical."
