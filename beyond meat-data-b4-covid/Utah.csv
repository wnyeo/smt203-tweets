2019,@lildumbassseal honestly there are so many great meat substitutes that you can cook your favorite meals with. beyond meat is an awesome plant based no soy protein source and i also use gardinia a lot! pretty much any recipe can be modified and made vegan :-)

No longer like any pork, very rarely chicken or fish, still struggling with beef. Working on it.
Next will be animal milk, then eggs.

2019,"Y‚Äôall. I tried a Beyond Meat burger.

As a meat eater, I was curious about all the fuss about these and Impossible Burgers.

I have to say, I was thoroughly impressed. The texture, the taste, everything was 99.9% spot-on! The taste varied ever so slightly from the real thing 1/2"

2019,First time eating @BeyondMeat burger. Always wanted to try. It was worth the wait. Absolutely amazing. Better than the real thing
2019,"Lab-grown meat! When science and public demand align, amazing things can happen. Traditional producers will have to adapt in more interesting ways than defending the word 'meat.' @BeyondMeat"
2019,"@amyythevegan Meat: Gardein, Tofurkey, Beyond meat, Field roast 
Cheese: Diaya, Chao, Vio life (my personal fave), Miyokos 
Milk: Silk brand has soy, cashew, coconut, almond etc. you can find many brands of plant based milk in almost every store. 
Just to name a few!"
