2021,"@kilday_morgan i get that it might be appealing to meat-eaters who are transitioning to a plant-based diet (maybe? who knows? probably not), but it is a goddamn nightmare for those of us firmly entrenched in the veggie world who want nothing to do with anything meaty."
2021,This same thing happened to me 😔 my roommate was eating like 90% plant based then she got back with her ex and now she eats meat eggs and cheese daily 😔😔 https://t.co/j4DW0QwOqN
2021,"@upnorth2020 @JeremyVineOn5 I’d be interested to see any proven link between Quorn and coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer and strokes common with meats. Anyhoo most vegans follow a whole foods plant based diet which avoids meat substitutes because of concerns over processed foods."
2021,"@DBTayor There is no way you're going to convince me he is going to eat plant based ""meat.""  Is he using a private plane?  Does he use mass transit?  Nope.

The dude can afford the best money can buy and I'm sure he buys it for himself."
2021,"Rubbish. This plant-based fake meat is ultra-processed food, often with dubious ingredients and a lot of food miles. #EatRealFood https://t.co/abXa7NV4ll"
2021,"@adblanche I bet it is a thing but there's a few plant based social media communities that have launched recently

My faves are products that don't try too hard to Be Meat (e.g. trader Joe's masala burger?? Elite)"
2021,"@Edwards46L @JoeyDevlin_ I don't understand why it's so hard for people to grasp the concept that it's not a matter of it not ""looking like meat"" for most plant based ppl but a matter of it not actually being meat from a slaughtered animal. It makes a lot of sense to me."
2021,@TheGaychel Yes! The “meat” is plant based and it tastes no different.
2021,Modern Plant-Based Foods appoints Anastasia Bogomolova as Director of Operations https://t.co/5VtD25Ny0g @TheModernMeat #PlantBasedMeat #PlantBasedSeafood
2021,@kelly_rdc I eat leftover Beyond Meat plant based meatballs and sausages without reheating.
2021,"Trying to find a plant based roast and keep getting shown meat steaks. I mean, I guess it makes sense but that’s not right."
2021,"Arguably eat better and get a metric fuckton more exercise nowadays, but still... Signature Select Flatbreads were a vibe in their own (quick &amp; easy); but spinach, fried egg, plant-based meat alternatives and a splendid-ass sauteed/halved bell pepper trump that shit on the daily."
2021,"@aiddya Depends if they are “plant based” or “don’t like meat” 

I’m gonna suspect that it varies a lot :)"
2021,"@Stella20203126 Awesome!!

I'm hoping we can get  Plant-based system(not even serve dairy or meat) in Seattle schools...

Are you in the UK?
It seems they are ahead of US on the Vegan movement."
2021,"Look. I love meat and fish, and there are lots of people who can’t eat a vegan diet for a multiplicity of reasons, but plant-based meals can be exquisite! https://t.co/rbAtmwL69C"
2021,"@JesseKIRO7 It is not as bad as you might think, plant based diets just take time to adjust too.  However avoid the common trap of to much pasta and cheeses.  Carbs sometimes are allowed to take the place of meat and derail what you are trying to accomplish.  Good luck."
2021,"@illeniem Cats - need meat
Dogs - can be plant based with a vet’s approval"
2020,This is fucked up if you ask me.. genetically altering pigs so that people who are allergic to red meat can eat them. Why not just eat the plant based alternative 😩 Do they really think meat sales are declining because of allergies?? https://t.co/VyFPkCVAGe
2020,"@lauraloupart @Randalf_osrs @reganmarie114 Farm animals are supplemented with b12, their meat doesn’t naturally contain much if any at all. So cut out the middle man and supplement b12. Your friend is not vegan if they sometimes eat meat - they’re plant based."
2020,"@AJA_Cortes Where do you think the meat you eat gets it’s amino acids from...? Soy alone contains a complete amino acid profile that your body needs. Apes, elephants, rhinos.. all are examples of strong, long living mammals with plant based muscle."
2020,You guys know there’s more plant based food bc we’re running out of meat right🥴
2020,"All, 
(Meat/Carne=¿decapatated life source?) 
Meat Dispensaries Should Legally Be Required to remind every single meat consumer of Plant Based Substitutes every single time.
#Inocentemeatconsumption"
2020,So I love Impossible but sometimes tough to find. Any advice on best plant-based meat options? Including home deliveries. #vegan #plantbased  #vegetarian
2020,"Honestly, I’m a huge fan of plant-based meat. But this particular Gardein burger tastes like vomit. I know people say that, but this does. Probably because it’s Canadian and you are always drunk and puking when you barbecue I imagine. Tastes like home to them I guess. 🇨🇦🍔 https://t.co/Y2stdlgdEv"
2020,Moo if I have a injured internal organ toxins  collected organically in my plant based diet will leak into my meat before I go poo just like in you.. https://t.co/RxmBlpL3cB
2020,"Plant-based spaghetti with mostly vegan ""meat"" sauce (I added some honey) and garlic bread cuz you know, baby steps lol

I made it this time 🙃

2020,"Araya's plant-based meat with peanut sauce noodles: wide noodles, plant-base meat, seasonal vegetables, carmelized onions and mushrooms, in garlic and curry powder, topped with bean sprouts and peanut sauce.… https://t.co/0hE4EDuXTU"
2020,"Ok. So how about we make a plant based sandwich. Except instead of being plant based, it’s not, at all, except for the meat. We should keep dairy in the bread. We should toss cheese on it. Add an egg! And *chefs kiss* we have a non-vegan sandwich, exactly like the rest! 🌱 🌱 https://t.co/Dbe2zw8bRN"
2020,Aaron’s coworkers talked shit about him eating plant based protein. They said they could never. I wish he recorded their reaction when he told them that both chili’s were actually made with BEYOND MEAT. They all couldn’t taste the difference. ATE. IT. UP 🤣🤣🤣 https://t.co/kfIDA6E3oK
2020,"THERES AN ACTUAL NAME FOR MY DIET!! 😂 

Not 100% vegetarian, not 100% vegan. My diet is mostly plant based with some to very little meat so, apparently I'm a FLEXITARIAN!! I just learned thats a thing and I'm stupidly excited about it 😂"
2020,Current conditions and chaos/bad faith in meatpacking industry are a great catalyst for plant-based growth. Not to mention higher prices for meat across the board. https://t.co/s1AEIMPVis
2020,@DrEricDing @TysonFoods A really good idea is to stop eating so much meat and start eating more plant based meals. Stop buying from huge corporations and shop local. #meatfreeamerica #plantbased
2020,"@feelinmyself365 @_kayswole Honestly, it’s not as complicated as you’d think. It’s just like cooking with meat products only with plant-based ingredients. To me, it’s a new way to enjoy my favs and celebrate my roots."
