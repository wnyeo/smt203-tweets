2021,@John_G_Willis He is one of the wealthiest individuals in the world.  Why is he peddling plant based fake meats?  Seems odd and out of sorts….even if he has invested in a fake meat company.   Is there more to the story?

2021,"@BobVGann @Lloydi_COYS @ft_content @Tesco Actual plants are better not plant based made in a lab food.
Actual real meat and veg is best. Anything that has been processed and had ""stuff"" added isnt going to be good for us.
You even said processed food was bad with stuff added in. Now you're arguing they arent 🤷‍♂️🙈🤡"
2021,"@BobVGann @Lloydi_COYS @ft_content @Tesco Your plant based stuff is also packed with hormones and casues cancer, processed meat can cause cancer yes, becuase they are processed in factories just like your plant based processed stuff. Same shit, different base protein. Real organic meat has natural hormones, not extra 1's"

2021,"@WeWantSomeMo28 Gluten and dairy free! Although I’m not super strict on myself. I eat as plant based as I can, I rarely eat meat anymore. Luckily there’s a lot of alternatives. I also stopped snacking between meals unless I’m super hungry. Mostly just eating for energy and not for fun lol"

2021,"@asphodelmoon @loudnaijagirl I’ve noticed it being used for this as well, but I was taught (a while ago) that it was for vegans who were actively ok with people eating meat... like the same ones who are plant based for health reasons, but will still buy wool, leather, fur, etc and also buy meat for friends."
2020,"@peta I prefer both meat and plant based foods. So, I'm both vegan and non-vegan. I like broccoli as much as I do a steak. Also, plants are living organisms too. So, really you are killing both animal and plants at the same time if you think about it. Both contain cells."
2020,"@_beccaharrison I prefer dairy milk to milk substitutes, but I also reject rhetoric like the term ‘Ultra Processed’. I hate when my fellow meat eaters do this with plant based protein as well.

I hated when anti GMO activists invoked images of syringes injecting tomatoes &amp; I won’t do the same."
