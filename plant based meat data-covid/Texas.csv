2020,"Vegans/Vegetarians 

Stop trying to tell us how immoral eating meat is in order to sway our opinion. You think too much of us.

Instead, try explaining how it’s proven to be overall better for you in just about every testable way to eat a plant based diet. 

Seems more effective."
2020,Lol I bought me some nachos from taco cabana with plant based meat and tell me why my brother ate most of them and goes damn that shit fire 😂😂
2020,"Last day of my weekly plant-based 3-day period? I’m feeling amazing!

What am I doing?:
Monday through Wednesday of each week is plant based!

Why am I doing it?:
I watched a health documentary called “The Game Changers” dove deep into the effects of meat on the body! https://t.co/EHSdd9sCzJ"
2020,@Slimreefah @xNotTheAVERAGE I’m going back to eating meat. Minimal. But for two weeks I did go plant based. I do not recommend though if you’re picky
2020,"@theOfficialcjay @RioDashaee_ So I actually went plant based like these last two weeks which I don’t recommend lol if you are a picky eater. I’m going back to my original meal plan which is minimal meat and bread, eating mostly veggies and fruits and getting my protein from there"
2020,"@mariemamiii @RachTofu Post more!!! I still eat meat (except pork), but I like seeing the plant based/vegan alternatives that are out there.👍"
2020,"My favorite thing about eating plant based is cooking. I didn’t cook nearly as much as I do now when I ate meat, and it’s becoming one of my favorite parts of my day."
2020,"@arasIanian I would definitely try just plant based first, I started slowly substituting meat with vegan options but I still eat meat when I want. When I restrict myself from certain things it does tend to make me want to restrict myself more and more without me realizing til it’s too late:/"
2020,"@on_drayy_uhh @zach0y Not necessarily, there is more than 1 company in the beverage, footwear, apparel, construction, manufacturing, food, airline, car industries etc.  So why can't there be more than 1 successful Plant Based Meat company? 🤷🏾‍♂️"

2020,my new year’s resolution this year is to reduce my consumption of meat/animal products and make at least one plant-based meal per day. it’ll be a lot easier once i get back to UNT and the mean greens cafeteria but until then catch me googling all sorts of recipes.
