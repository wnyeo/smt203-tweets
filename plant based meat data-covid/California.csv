2020,@ChachiBobinks Didn‚Äôt say you liked them. Said they tried to change the name to ‚Äúplant based‚Äù to market them to you. I mean why do meat eaters care if something is plant based?

2020,"@Cami_llia @USATODAY BK cooks the patty using a diff method if you ask.

If veganism continues to increase, maybe we will get there :)"

‚ÄúIf you could only choose one diet, would you eat strictly meat, or a balanced whole food plant based diet?‚Äù"
2020,"For the record too. I thought that whole thing about eating plant based meat ""makes you less than a man"" while it simultaneously takes a dig at transfolk is complete and utter bullshit. Fuck those people, eat what you want and embrace who you are! ‚úä‚úä‚úä"
