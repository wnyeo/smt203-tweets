2021,"@mama_c2 Mama, we think alike. I’ve been posting recently about all the merits of cooking w/plant based meat!"
2021,I have eaten plant based (vegan) for 480 days. I have never missed meat once. I barely miss eggs or milk. I think this way of eating will stick.
2021,Would it be wrong if me to put “meat based 🥩” in my bio since all the vegans/veggies but “plant based 🌱” in theirs?

2021,"@ColinParent I believe around 3% of all products purchased from the “fresh meat” department of grocery stores in 2020 was plant based. That’s HUGE when you think about how small the plant based section is, and this doesn’t include frozen items."
2021,"@ColinParent YES! I’ve been following the changes in consumer trends driving this industry’s growth 25+% during 2020. In the same way that driving hybrid/EVs used to label you a wimp or hippy (now completely different), plant based meat seems to be trending away from that labeling as well."

2020,"Ate pizza at Amici’s today with Beyond Meat “sausage”. Was impressed with flavor and texture. If I ate it without knowing it was plant-based, I would have had no idea. Even when I picked off some “sausage” and ate it on its own, I strained to tell the difference. @BeyondMeat 👍🏽"
2020,@EdwardTHardy All Whoppers deserve equal protection under the law! Be they meat or plant based! @ImpossibleFoods @BurgerKing
2020,@sethbannon @i3impact I believe the biggest selling point of quinoa for a long time was that it contained ALL 9 essential amino acids found in meat and was not missing any like many plant based sources
2020,"@IanCramer @kevinnbass Ian there is one question I would love you to ask Kevin and if you can provide the answer as a quote or audio excerpt I will post it across all my social media.

“If you could only choose one diet, would you eat strictly meat, or a balanced whole food plant based diet?”"
2020,"For the record too. I thought that whole thing about eating plant based meat ""makes you less than a man"" while it simultaneously takes a dig at transfolk is complete and utter bullshit. Fuck those people, eat what you want and embrace who you are! ✊✊✊"
