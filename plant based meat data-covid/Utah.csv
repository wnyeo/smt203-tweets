2021,"might be a hot take buuutt
fake meat (i.e. impossible / beyond meat) is NOT healthier nor better for the planet. either eat a plant based diet or locally sourced humanely raised REAL meat if you’re going to preach about having a more environmentally friendly diet."
2021,@silvia_araoz @seaspiracy Fish is meat. And industrial fishing is destroying the planet. And fish is full of awful stuff that you shouldn’t consume. There are tons of plant-based alternatives that give you the taste without the awful consequences of eating animals and supporting the fishing industry.
2021,@A_Frayed_Mind @RationalDis We live in a world where a former presidential advisor tried scaring people by claiming Biden was going to force Americans to drink “plant-based beer”. Chalking up their success to an all-meat diet when they’re erroneously assuming something is meat when it’s not isn’t lying.

2020,"Front &amp; center they call plant based barf burgers from @BeyondMeat served at @DennysDiner a “heathier” option for 2020. 🤪 Comparing it to the likes of Oat Milk (which is actually like other nut waters just oat water 🤫).
