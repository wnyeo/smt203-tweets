2021,"@sea_l_bass @AlokSharma_RDG @beisgovuk @DefraGovUK @ZacGoldsmith @VictoriaPrentis @COP26 I'm not entirely sure if this is true but apparently the menu at COP26 has meat, fish and poultry on it. They could have gone 100% plant based but chose not too which isn't at all surprising. Its a terrible message to send out."
2021,"@GailWadsworth @latimes I see your point, but wouldn’t a shift to plant based alternatives also end CAFOs? If it is done in a sustainable manner it seems to support your end goals. 

Nobody is saying people can’t eat meat if they want, but if people are happy with these alternatives, I think it’s great."

2021,So we have reached a curious place: Republicans want to turbocharge meat as a culture war issue at the same time that they seek to gag companies from exercising their First Amendment rights to say “plant-based meat.” Insert joke about cancel culture here.
2021,"Politicians who take money from the meat industry, disproportionately Republicans, are trying to ban plant-based meat companies from using that phrase; this is the real political battle around meat today, and it’s a bona fide attack on free speech. https://t.co/4YyAr8puIB"
2021,"One point of “plant-based meat” is to drain the culture war overtones from the whole meat debate, to reframe the conversation: You aren’t refraining from meat, you’re just eating a different kind of meat. That’s why the meat industry is trying to censor these products and ads."

2021,@JamesRSchulte YESSS! Slight problem: many of us now have given up red meat in favor of “plant based diets” or have become lactose intolerant and can’t eat cheese or Frosties. Or fried foods give us heartburn. So we may need to reenact by stopping at Sweetgreen instead. 🤷🏾‍♀️
