2021,"Call me old fashioned, but I prefer vegetarian to “plant based”. I’ve had a few “boca burgers” before, but this “plant based” fake meat stuff, no thank you.🤢🤮 I would rather eat a grilled portobello mushroom burger than that “impossible meat” stuff. Reminds me of #SoylentGreen."
2021,@2ndcitydigest I think it’s unlikely any of the larger meat companies successfully execute a project launching plant based meat.  It’s a totally different manufacturing process and requires a lot of r&amp;d iterations.  Disrupting your own revenue streams is a difficult task.

2020,@AquafabaMcGee Vegan hot dogs taste just like the lisps and assholes meat eaters love so why wouldn’t they choose the plant based option?
2020,@myerscb @KetoCarnivore @jonnettlefold And what you mentioned about thriving probably applies to the lesser omnivores like dogs ..... dogs can survive on plants but they will never thrive..... humans can do better than dogs on plant based diets however they can potentially thrive with meat added I agree
