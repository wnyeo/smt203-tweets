2019,@AlexFerentinos7 @juliannejtaylor @FoodFirst_Ty Whole food plant based - healthy vegan unprocessed or minimally processed food.
2019,2019 was a good year for all these new plant based food options. That’s all I’m looking forward to in 2020: new/more foods that’ll maintain this thiccness.
2019,@iam_preethi I had a decade of bad health on the Carnivore / Keto diet - resolved by going whole food plant based (healthy vegan) 7 years now.  Actually read research instead of taking internet seriously.  Surprising how much of the “carnivore research” is illegitimate. Critical thinking. 🌱
2019,@MikeAlbertMD @virtahealth I’ve been off insulin for 9 years after transitioning to a whole food plant based diet. My A1c dropped from 12.5 in 2010 and it has been between 4.9 and 5.2 ever since. When may I say that I reversed my T2D? https://t.co/Nr67IrhAWh

2019,"This New Year, rather than go to the gym for 2 weeks and fail on Keto again, why not try whole food plant based (healthy vegan) nutrition instead, and just walk 30-60 mins/day to start. Go 100%, find mentors, and in just 3 weeks you may feel like you stepped out of the Matrix!"
2019,@SamMoulton @MichaelCade1 I believe U can get what U need from plants &amp; some supplements might B warranted.
