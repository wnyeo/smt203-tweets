2019,@AlexFerentinos7 @juliannejtaylor @FoodFirst_Ty Whole food plant based - healthy vegan unprocessed or minimally processed food.
2019,2019 was a good year for all these new plant based food options. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm looking forward to in 2020: new/more foods that‚Äôll maintain this thiccness.
2019,@iam_preethi I had a decade of bad health on the Carnivore / Keto diet - resolved by going whole food plant based (healthy vegan) 7 years now.  Actually read research instead of taking internet seriously.  Surprising how much of the ‚Äúcarnivore research‚Äù is illegitimate. Critical thinking. üå±
