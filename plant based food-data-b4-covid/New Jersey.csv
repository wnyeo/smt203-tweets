2019,"@TravisMcP It drives my vegan friends crazy that when I order plant-based when I’m with them, I go old-school vegan and never ordered any of this processed crap. They wonder why. I show them the packaging—their faux “meats” are more processed than anything fast food offers. 😂"

2019,@kobychill Meat is generally more expensive than the plant based foods you need to get the same nutritional value from. No one is asking anyone to be vegan. That’s a philosophy. What’s being asked is that people reduce their consumption of animal byproducts. U don’t need meat. Period.
