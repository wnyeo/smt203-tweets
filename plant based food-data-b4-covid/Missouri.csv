2019,"1. I eat (mostly) a plant-based diet &amp; enjoy it tremendously.

2. Yes, you can be a vegan &amp; eat too many unhealthy foods. https://t.co/tCEJJ1fG8L"

2019,"At last!
Impossible Foods’ plant-based “meat” is coming to 102 more stores https://t.co/48EEQvMvNH"
2019,@VodkaMuse Whole-food plant-based carbs are good for you.  So is masturbation.
2019,"@IanCramer It’s an identity struggle to be healthy and not eat animals. The vegan mafia comes after you if you identify as whole-food plant based, but I also don’t want to identify just as vegan, because I don’t eat that crap either. So I have to type that I’m a WFPBNO vegan."
2019,"“...words are needed to convey meaning to consumers beyond just animal content.  Using the word ground “meat” tells me something about how the food is expected to be cooked and served...In this instance, using “meat” with “plant-based” is helpful to the consumer insofar...” https://t.co/vZQJCaTFhS"
2019,"Went to Whole Foods for just a few things. I’m so excited to try our vegan burgers + chicken and Ty was literally freaking out at all the plant based options and sustainable products. 
He’s so adorable, haha! https://t.co/zBM1HT66G5"
2019,"@orangebobevil @nikofreiher @DrNealBarnard Nonsense.  “Nutritional scientists” are mostly bought and paid for by special interest groups like the Dairy Council.  A vegan diet can certainly be a junk food diet (French fries are vegan), but a whole food, plant-based diet never is.  You are only fooling yourself, dude."
2019,"@in2caffeine @DrNealBarnard @drjkahn Yes, there is... whole food, plant-based."
2019,"Check out the bookshelf I sponsored at Neighborhood Reads the next time you’re in Washington, MO. Lots of great whole food plant-based books to choose from. https://t.co/FWXoZ6zN4N"
2019,"@farmermegzz Love it! “...Instead of saying your body needs protein and listing ways to get that protein, Health Canada said ""choose protein foods that come from plants more often...Why not let the individual figure out what works best for them based on dietary goals, demands, restrictions?”"
2019,"“Finding appealing ways for individuals to consume more plant-based foods like fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts and legumes can boost nutrition and still be compatible with eating appropriate amounts of animal foods to obtain essential nutrients.” #sustainablediet https://t.co/r2ScXF551f"
2019,@JNJNews It’s easy.  Reverse type-2 diabetes by adhering to a whole-food plant-based diet.
2018,@TRowePrice His cholesterol problems are resolved by simply eating a whole-food plant based diet. Invest in that.
2018,"Plant-based meat, plant-based milk, and many more... will bring revolution to our food system and give us a more sustainable future. Glad I am part of that effort at @BensonHillBio with great scientists. https://t.co/nCKJHiHcq4"
2018,@RichardsColeson @annaweirrr A raw plant based diet is exactly you surviving without processed foods quit looking a fool
2018,"Happy Transformation Tuesday!! 
It feels so good to be healthy! All  because I chose food with plant based eating over and above my life. 
What’s your excuse today? I had a million of… https://t.co/AfMoUVt5g9"
2018,"2. Plant based and alternative (i.e., cellular) proteins are receiving substantial investments as venture capitalists see these options as disruptive to an outdated food supply chain."
2018,Last week I attended the very interesting Future of Food-Tech conference (https://t.co/ilOrKW3zv8) in New York where I learned about the next generation of investment in plant-based and other alternative proteins. These were my top 3 takeaways:
2018,"@sarahalkaissi Yes, the cheapest foods may be plants, but often times people who eat plant based diets also take supplements. Which are not the cheapest things to obtain. And again are not even always readily available in every community."
2018,"@X_Confucius “However, plant-based eating isn't just about the addition of whole, plant foods such as fruits, veggies, legumes, grains, nuts and seeds, but also the elimination of ALL animal products including meat, fish, eggs, dairy, gelatin and other animal byproducts from one's diet.”"
2018,@guav @jrmyknly @jordanburak8 You’re confusing plant-based with vegan. It’s two different things. Ones strictly food and one is more than that.
2018,"@thelonewclf @megsawad @soybeanqueenn When you buy meat and dairy you support a money hungry, greedy, selfish industry that does not give a shit about you. Eating a whole food plant-based diet is the best thing and easiest thing anyone can do to be less harmful for all beings, included ourselves, earth, and others."
