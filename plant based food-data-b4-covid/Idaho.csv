2019,"Does the fact that a lot of my food ate plants count towards a ""plant-based"" diet?"
2018,My testosterone increased from 220 ng/dL (low for an 80 y/o man) to 1110 ng/dL (high for an 18 y/o) after I transitioned from the standard American diet to a whole food plant-based (healthy vegan) diet. I’m 59 - let’s compete athletically and see which of us are more masculine. https://t.co/KLdVjo50Xo
