2019,"2048 is when commercial fishing stocks will be depleted. Meat and plant based foods won’t support 10bn people. We will face the Earth’s 6th mass extinction. When the ocean dies, we die. https://t.co/kayLWLOssU"
2019,"@SpencerCKing1 @kevinnbass @lightningwilks @chriskresser @joerogan WFPB means whole food plant based, or healthy vegan food. I strive to eat WFPBNO and not to eat vegan junk foods. But yes, I am a lifestyle vegan, for my health, for animals, and for the planet."

2019,"Have you tried an #ImpossibleBurger?  It’s incredible how much it looks, tastes, and feels like a meat burger. 

I think plant based foods will lead to a better future. https://t.co/ULFhBmb3m9"
2019,"• Whey
• Plant based
• Collagen which is great for the skin, hair and nail growth
• Food packed with protein; eggs, cheese, chicken, almonds, and cottage cheese are just a few
Getting enough protein in your diet every day is critical, not only for your body."

2019,"Plant-based, organic, and grass-fed Half &amp; Half! At Eloise’s Cooking Pot we believe that our clients should have have high-quality options to choose from when they come to the food bank. https://t.co/kFIpjrABiU"
2019,I just saw an apple cider donut on Instagram tagged #plantbased. Guys... we’re getting confused here. The point of a plant-based diet is to eat more actual plants. And whole foods. A pile of maple syrup and coconut sugar doesn’t make you healthier just because it’s gluten-free.
2019,"This is one of my happiest of happy places.  The bar I call home, Life on Mars, surrounded by records....and amazing people, plant-based food, and the best drinks ever.  Really proud of this place.… https://t.co/yPFdbo96JP"

2019,@J_N_Rosenfeld @squire1888 @SteakAndIron Non processed plant based diet is very healthy  I support the hell out of that choice.  I eat a meat based diet no smoking no drinking no carbs and it's healthy. Please support the meat eaters too. Let's end this crappie food environment together.

2019,"@Popdust ""HelloFresh"" does not bring up to my mind a slab of meat as shown in your photo. Fresh is a term for plant based foods, not this stringy artery-churtling phantasm."

I love all kinds of food. Unfortunately my gut took a turn a few years ago, which meant changing my food instead of taking a pill. This meant switching to plant based. I do delve into the occasional non plant meal, just for fun, but I maintain plant based."
2019,"@KanskeBra It may very well be a “thing” in America, but I wouldn’t touch it ever. These things tend to pass me by. Plant based food, here. And though fried chicken has a place in my past, I would surely die an early death if I ate that now. So no, it’s not a thing for some of us. 🤣🤣🤣🤣"
2018,What they don't tell you about cooking lots of plant-based food is you will eventually own every product from Bob's red Mill and your tiny apartment pantry just won't cut it anymore. See… https://t.co/Qzh8A7wi3j

2018,"Why not just eat vegetables.  Why alter the food? Fake sausage, why ""pretend"" your eating meat?!  Im confused!💙 
Anyways.. I prefer plant based over vegan.  At any rate, I am trying! But tomorrow Im cooking chicken.  Please forgive me💙"
2018,I will be first in line. @NextLevelBurger makes great food and the fact that it is plant based is a bonus.  Proud to welcome them into @CenturyLink_Fld to feed the #12s on Thursday. https://t.co/Sr0aRggqkZ
2018,"@richroll We need to decide which will die: (A) the animal agriculture industry or (B) the planet and it's inhabitants. Choosing (A) will shift the debate from ""It's my right to eat meat if I want"" to debates about plant-based diet, cultured meats and insects for food. #plantbasedworkplace"
2018,"@SkyNews @JasmijndeBoo @ProVeg_Int We're less than 20 years away from the ""its my right to eat meat if I want"" debate to the necessity of diets being plant-based, lab-grown/cultured meat and insects for food. Most people are in denial about the threat climate change will have on our lives and future generations."
2018,@FiveThirtyEight Good lord. What percent haven't eaten fast food this year? It's partly due to Seattle not having any fast food and to only eating plant-based
2018,I wrote my book hoping to convince businesses and individuals to be mindful of how food choices impact human and planetary health... and adopting a plant-based diet is the only plausible solution to address both. 🌱🌏#plantbasedworkplace #CSR #ClimateAction #systemsthinking https://t.co/W4nocFUxDx
2018,wtf @Costco - you got rid of your one plant based protein salad. It was delicious. Well now I'm down to only dog food and couple random things (I do not need) I buy from you I guess. Curious if it's worth that $120/year. 😑
