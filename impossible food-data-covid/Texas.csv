2021,Impossible Foods Eyes $7 Billion Valuation in Fundraising https://t.co/t6FIaT68dN
2021,"the truth is hidden in plain sight. 

impossible to see with your eye closed.

2021,"THREE boss characters attack you all at the same time while you have to beat them one by one. You CAN'T avoid them all attacking you together. At BEST you beat one and by then your food supply is gone and the remaining two kill you.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE."
2021,"At this point, it feels as those retired teachers are forgotten about. Is impossible to pay for Medicare, put food on the table, and address medical issues while keeping a roof over your head. It seems that we have money for everything else."
2021,"@NgetichGilbertK @Grffn_CIC It's already too late since it's now impossible to find enough pure strain corn, soybean or rapeseed since it has all been contaminated with GE traits that make it unhealthy for food,feed or seeds."
2021,"something about skinny girls on tiktok showing us stuffing their faces with humanly impossible amounts of food is just a big NO , let it be a fat girl and that comment section would be so different"
2021,"@pulte Now that it is just me and my foster son, I am struggling more than ever.

Once my husbands income left and my oldest moved to college, taking care of two of us on my disability income turns out is impossible.

Electric is $331 and cuts off tomorrow. This month I chose food."
2021,"@2ndcitydigest There isn‚Äôt anything keeping larger food companies from making a similar product at a lower cost and with greater distribution. They have a patent, but so does Impossible Foods. That‚Äôs my point - another food company can easily enter the space."
2021,"This is disappointing, considering they have a better product than Impossible Foods. I'd be interested in seeing Impossible's sales.

In general this is good and telling the Greenie Weenies to go fuck themselves. https://t.co/VABUKrFJAI"
2021,it‚Äôs impossible to set out food for a party and NOT eat it
2021,"@mustachetoilet Obviously there is more to any diet than literally two foods but writing off a vegan diet because Impossible Burgers are pricey when fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes are not is disingenuous. Idc if someone is vegan or not but it being expensive is not a good argument."
2021,"Bro you don‚Äôt want to try an impossible burger?

I mean I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶..

You like to kill animals you don‚Äôt think this plant based burger doesn‚Äôt taste good?

I mean yea I‚Äôll try it‚Ä¶.

Yea you will thank you for shopping at Whole Foods. https://t.co/pniPv0qCRR"
2021,"I love a great food discovery as much as anyone but the line outside InterStellar BBQ since this @TexasMonthly list hit makes it an impossible drop in lunch spot for me. Saw some people hauling luggage in that line. Will revisit later. What else is cooking, Cedar Park? üçó‚è∞üí® https://t.co/jfbrPs17Gp https://t.co/gEgfWfslE5"
2021,"Also, these hogs ain't gonna be laughing when it becomes impossible to grow food in sufficient quantities due to climate change. Laughing at California underwater ain't gonna do jack to feed you in 2041."
