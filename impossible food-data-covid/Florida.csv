2021,"@valhuntbeauty I have three cats, the kitchen is a galley style with wide openings and two entrances exits.  It would be impossible to keep them out.

They never go on counters and they have no interest in human foods so only occasionally even go through the kitchen."
2021,*IMPOSSIBLE FOODS IS SAID IN FUNDRAISING TALKS AT $7B VALUATION
2021,"@MSNBC Lots of talk about childcare credits, pre-K, &amp; family &amp; medical leave. None of those benefit me buto happy to support them. How about something for Social Security. 6% increase is not adequate. Living on Social Security with inflation &amp; rising food cost is impossible."
2021,"Select bourbons are impossible and there's a few issues with beer. Price has obviously gone up on everything.

Otherwise cigs, liquor and sugary foods/drinks are still flowing in no problem"
2021,"@pulte I'll wear them to drive &amp; watch TV because if I don't I literally can't see anything thats not right in front of me. Sucks. Then the rent part I'm behind &amp; have 2 kids so having to decide between groceries, certain bills, &amp; rent is impossible. I go to food banks but don't lastüòî https://t.co/jeD4NvrWzz"
2021,"@lesleyabravanel @SRuhle @GovRonDeSantis I notice that food prices are very expensive. Prescription prices went up a lot too. I buy it anyway because I have no choice but my income has gone down making it near impossible to make ends meet. 

Employers are not offering more money. Not in Florida."
2021,@JoeyDevlin_ That‚Äôs a fair take and I do see what you were getting at. Obviously the true real ‚Äúpurpose‚Äù of food is to nourish. But i think it‚Äôs hard if not impossible to completely dissociate emotion and pleasure from food.
2021,"1/Citizens of the U.S.A. are in an almost impossible position... we, at home, must conserve energy, recycle properly and buy processed foods to feed our families. If you are ""poor"" you cannot buy a Saturday morning coffee and donut and take a walk without being admonished..."
2021,"Food round up: impossible slider with wasabi slaw at Earth Eats booth. Fried falafel pita at Morocco Pavilion (forgot photo before we ate half), bbq jackfruit impossible burger at regal eagle. @ Epcot https://t.co/QGmLxdNfZs"
2021,"You would never know these are vegetarian thanks to @impossible_foods @ Miami Beach, Florida https://t.co/ptbOB6FGLr"
2021,@NioXoiN @naptimeanarchy @prussian_weeb @ThirtySevenBees @FirearmsRetro Yes it isn't that hard but if you live in a city it's virtually impossible I mean sure you can grow food in the roof of your building but like not everyone can do that and not everyone has access of doing that and it's very unrealistic. If you live in a suburb than yeah u can.
2021,@Markus64 @ImpossibleFoods @gardein I like the impossible from a junk food perspective. Wouldn‚Äôt be bad on a parm hero
2021,"@impossible_foods impossible burger, impossibly delicious!

2021,"@WDWGuestService Chef Neel knocked it out of the park with my allergy safe impossible Burger on GF bun, I‚Äôm so full and happy! I can‚Äôt tell you how hard it is to find food that is safe for me, when I feel full it‚Äôs a real treat! #castcompliment https://t.co/82E5Ql7jEA"
2021,"Recently ventured to Red Rooster in Miami‚Äôs Overtown neighborhood. It‚Äôs currently the only restaurant in the state of Florida with the new @impossible_foods plant-based chicken nuggets. And, OMFG, people‚Ä¶ they are amazing‚Ä¶ just like every other thing Impossible has done so far. https://t.co/rGFqRVwtEv"
2021,"@BillGates impossible burgers and beyond burgers are good.. im pretty certain that mcdyis dieing. I'm here for the BigMac and a Quarter Pounder.. horrible.. great marketing but bad product. They've lost what once made them famous. Marketing, gimmicks, toys, technology..but food?"
