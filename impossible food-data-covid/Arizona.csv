2021,@sofonofos @WhoTheFIsAP I do not believe that I have tried any of the fast food chains Impossible burgers. But the green chile one sounds solid. (Now that Iâ€™ve taken some time apart from hatch green chiles - needed my space) ðŸ˜†
2021,Still stuck in quarantine and I would kill for  the ability to DoorDash some food but apparently being in a dorm makes it impossible to have people deliver to your doorstep
2021,Now that Alina is walking itâ€™s impossible to get her to eat her food ðŸ˜‘ she just wants to walk around and play
2021,"@jimk849 Getting a recipe from my wife is next to impossible. She has nothing written down. She is a food whisperer. Especially with soups and stews. That women can go to the fridge, and turn what ever  is in there into amazing meals!!"
2021,"@RevDMQ Me too! So, which is the correct analogy: differentiation in the church is as impossible as an addict living with a crack pipe (just put it down) OR differentiation in the church is as necessary as a person with an eating disorder learning proper relation to necessary food?"
2021,"To be honest, it was impossible for me to save for the future when I was younger because my family constantly needed me to dip into my savings in order to help put food on the table and keep a roof over my head. You can't ""save for a rainy day"" when your life is always a monsoon! https://t.co/VEDhmnzhg1"
2021,@badbchloe Impossible dd would get so many complaints. My food came soggy (mam u got animal fries delivered what do u expect) I work for them I see the complaints tell in and out to stay out lol
2021,@queenbeetacos @sffPHX Loved the food the other night but you guys were impossible to find. The posted address was wrong.
2021,"@ParsleyJane8 @ClayreInABQ @Marcus4Georgia @TheDemCoalition Our rule of law seems to be geared toward benefitting power elites with money.  Taking urgent action on transportation, water, food, energy &amp; habitat is made almost impossible by warring lawyers whose grotesque billable hours take prescedence over getting the right things done."
