2021,"#Impossible #Foods, a Redwood City, Calif.-based plant-based meat alternative company, is in talks to raise $500 million in funding, which would value the company at $7 billion, per Bloomberg. #consumer"
2021,"If you‚Äôre not prepared mentally for what‚Äôs to come, then it will be nearly impossible for you to survive. 

There‚Äôs no amount of food, water, money, etc. that can save you. 

Only God can prepare you and save you."
2021,"And look, I KNOW this is a first world problem. I know. I KNOW. But once you‚Äôve reheated food with an air fryer it‚Äôs impossible to go back. So now I‚Äôm looking at this fried chicken sandwich like do I wanna wash dishes lmao..."
2021,I need Impossible Foods to sponsor me
2021,"Say what you want about Burger King, but their partnership with Impossible Foods is really setting a precedent by making plant based options more convenient for consumers. First the launch of the Impossible Whopper and now the plant based chicken nuggets üëèüèæ"
2021,I‚Äôm so sick walking downstairs to get my food feels impossible
2021,@KetanJ0 @dog4climate The Impossible Whopper actually tastes just like a good fast food burger should -- delicious and insanely unhealthy. And I hear NotCo actually makes a good burger too. For the plant forward approach I'm curious about Actual Veggies (https://t.co/X5mKzO4IHW). Haven't tried it tho
2021,"@Bill_Maxwell_ It's almost impossible to keep it under the suggested 2300mg daily allowance. There are 2,000 mg in a teaspoon of salt and any prepackaged foods are loaded with it. Even canned vegetables. And you can forget about eating out."
2021,@netflix There better be another season of Baking Impossible in the works. Show was awesome. So much fun to watch them do interesting things with food.
2021,"I agree on the lack of virality but it was funny. Dave said they had ""Impossible Pussy"" and I legit spit out my food. https://t.co/NqhAkIxXMN"
2021,"The practical is sometimes the enemy of the necessary! We scoff at idealism because it‚Äôs difficult, not because it‚Äôs impossible. We move the deck chairs while the titanic sinks, rather than figure out how to turn the ship. Join the movement to transform food systems! #engagefully https://t.co/Esd7nyaFSn"
2021,"@fireember345 I meant going to a good vegan restaurant, where they prepare their own patties.

As a newbie, you can try Impossible Foods products to cook by yourself."
