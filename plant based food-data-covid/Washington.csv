2021,"@upnorth2020 @JeremyVineOn5 I’d be interested to see any proven link between Quorn and coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer and strokes common with meats. Anyhoo most vegans follow a whole foods plant based diet which avoids meat substitutes because of concerns over processed foods."

2020,"@cynicalbroad @pdz_domain @salemo5111 @BorisJohnson Nah. The IPCC, and other scientists disagree. Plant based food system would automatically make things more efficient. A cow is 14% efficient at making protein and produces a lot of waste, pollution and uses far more land and water per kilo of “food” than anything else we grow."
2020,"@Bikash97819360 @stout_jonathan @pdz_domain @salemo5111 @BorisJohnson We feed and kill over one hundred billion land animals, which occupy 75% of all agricultural land. A plant based food system would free up half of that land and still provide the same caloric and nutritional value, enable rewilding, reducing pressure on natural systems &amp; climate."
2020,"@pdz_domain @salemo5111 @BorisJohnson Shifting to a plant based food system is scientifically shown to be better for animals, the planet and people."

2020,"@jheilesonRD @dougkalmanphdrd @amy_goodson_rd @NanciGuestRDPhD @JoseAntonioPhD I agree that vegetarians eat eggs and dairy. But eggs and dairy are not “plant based”, because they are made from animals, not plants. It’s complicated being an ethical vegan who eats only healthy vegan foods - why try and label us?"
2020,"@jheilesonRD @dougkalmanphdrd @amy_goodson_rd @NanciGuestRDPhD @JoseAntonioPhD “Whole food plant based” was eventually truncated to the acronym WFPB and abbreviated to just “plant based.” It has never, and does not now, have any meaning that includes any form of animal products. (3)"
2020,@jheilesonRD @dougkalmanphdrd @amy_goodson_rd @NanciGuestRDPhD @JoseAntonioPhD The term “whole food plant based”was coined by T Colin Campbell in 1982 to exclude vegan junk food from the meaning and to signify healthy vegan foods. https://t.co/JXFyLrB2DB (2)
