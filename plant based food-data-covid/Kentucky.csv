2021,"@Nutradvance As in whole food plant based, not just vegan."
2021,"@ScepticalDoctor @DrFuhrman @MictheVegan @nutrition_facts So no actual outcome based data?They are cooked with vegetable oil and 0 cholesterol and low saturated fat. Sodium could be concern, but are there associations with bad health outcomes for someone eating mostly whole food plant based / Mediterranean + some chips?"

2021,@mikeo3009 @DBelardoMD Not necessarily. Vegan junk foods can have a lot of saturated fats which can increase LDL. For lowest cholesterol a whole food plant based diet appears the way to go.
2021,"@KenDBerryMD Dang, then I must be a medical miracle. I reversed NAFLD on a whole food plant based diet including a huge bowl of daily steel cut oatmeal with banana, blueberries, walnuts and flaxseed."
2021,@Shane_of_AZ @The_Nutrivore My N=1 cancels out yours. I regained my health on a high carb whole food plant based diet. Now back to epidemiological evidence.
2021,"@Shane_of_AZ @BioLayne Well, then I have good news for you. A whole food plant based high carb diet will resolve any insulin resistance you may have acquired on a hflc diet. Carb away."
2021,"@dakbio @ethanjweiss That's just not true. I eat a high carb whole food plant based diet, lost and kept off over 40 lbs and have 0 hunger issues. You can do that equally on a low carb diet, but to villify carbs is just ridiculous."
2021,"@ShutterbugCTX @mosca_matthew Luckily you can address your insulin resistance by eating a whole food plant based diet. Works for both t1 and t2. For t1 it means you need less insulin, for t2 it means you can eat apples again and have excellent A1C."
2021,"@janvyjidak @ScepticalDoctor Went from 0 dietary cholesterol on whole food plant based diet to adding back 2 eggs Saturday's and 1 strip of bacon over a period of 3 months. Looking forward to @ScepticalDoctor experiment, as she does those things in a super controlled manner. My self reporting is less exact."
2021,@Nutradvance Thank you.Very objective and evidence based. Extremely refreshing. I say this as a whole food plant based eater.

2021,"@CatherineBann15 @DBelardoMD Yes your body makes all it needs, provided you don't bombard it with saturated fats and dietary cholesterol. Eating a whole food plant based diet with some EVOO thrown in normally does the trick. If not, then Dr. Belardo and her colleagues have more arrows in the quiver ;-)"
2021,"Hey, @Starbucks thank you for dedicating an entire store to plant-based innovation as @Kevin_Johnson acknowledged the ""dominant shift"" to plant-based in consumers. @AnimalOutlook and I cannot wait for a nationwide vegan food option."

2020,"@AtlasShruggedGB @nevinmillan @nutrition_facts It is also dense with dietary cholesterol and animal protein which evidence based science shows we need as much as a hole in the head.
Whole food plants + B12 supplement for the win."
