2021,@SportsFanGirl22 😂😂😂 funny fact I get actual plants and make my food from it. Most I grow myself. And others I always test to make sure it’s actual Organic if it’s bought from a store. His plant based soy toxins can go to Hell-0

2021,"@luckykittah Totally get that, I rely on plant based, beans, &amp; eggs. I do eat fish though, so that can give me a decent boost too. There are some decent 'convenience food' options that only require a bit of fussing to make them yummy, but it takes time to find what you like."

Two of my base habits are making my bed (something I couldn’t conquer as a child) &amp; putting lotion on my elbows.

2021,"WFPB (Whole Food Plant Based) diet doesn’t include any meat, poultry, fish, dairy, or eggs. But IT'S NOT the same as a vegan diet, which is defined only by what it eliminates. WFPB diet is defined also by what it emphasizes: a large variety of whole foods."
2021,@muhhlissa_ @mulburies @prettyliltyanna @ShesAltard Some vegans will eat a bunch of processed and junk food because it’s more about the animals and less about health.. where has someone to eat plant-based is more focused on health
2021,"@muhhlissa_ @mulburies @prettyliltyanna @ShesAltard No plant based is more of a whole food plant based diet. For example oats, veggies, fruit, beans, etc... Oreos are vegan.. but not not plant based if that makes sense?"

2020,@tomburka This is because of the organic food industry which has demonized the word chemical for there own profit. It’s “organic plant based Tear gas”
2020,being a vegetarian with an anxiety disorder be like “mmm yummy plant based burger! ...... a little TOO realistic... “ &amp; then you overthink &amp; never finish your food :-)

2020,"@ElNordas @DBelardoMD @tednaiman Keto diets, whether plant based or not, call for such a reduction in carbs, it would be impossible to get the recommended healthy amounts of fiber specifically from food like whole grains and legumes. Keto diets, and all iterations of the low carb diet are not healthy."
2020,"@melaninmamis Whole food plant based diet with HIIT and plenty of water 👌🏾

Also - focus on more than lbs. Take pics and measurements. Your body can change in all the right ways &amp; not lose an oz. Pinning it all on a # might leave you discouraged."
2020,"@devdaisydoodles @Julesrules39 @LeBradBarrow @LeoDiCaprio @goldenglobes A whole foods plant based diet doesn't rely on animal product substitutions. I understand lots of vegan recipes call for such things, but a whole foods plant based diet is not nearly as confusing as you imply."
2020,@jeroen_sluiter Exactly. It's for my health that I eat a whole foods plant based diet.
2020,@ecol0gy @LeoDiCaprio @goldenglobes I don't understand why people want to relate applauding the golden globes for serving plant based food with fires in Australia? I'm not getting that connection.
2020,@Sydfalcorules @LeoDiCaprio @goldenglobes Do you know how much sodium is in the standard American diet? Whole food plant based diets contain very little sodium.
2020,@Julesrules39 @LeBradBarrow @LeoDiCaprio @goldenglobes There are tons of resources for whole foods plant based diet. A Google search will easily find them.
2020,@SustainableDish @pinkcorgisrule @jeroen_sluiter @MarkRuffalo This is completely incorrect. A whole food plant based diet is the healthiest possible way of eating for all humans and for the planet.
