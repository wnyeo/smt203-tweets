2021,@mrBobbyBones Terribly irresponsible? The article you linked is a different discussion. I‚Äôm talking about basic health and nutrition. We have become so wrapped up and consumed with the idea that plant base is &gt; animal based. It‚Äôs a fad. But yet $$$ is pumped into cheap processed foods
2021,I don‚Äôt see how people be eating plant based foods. It‚Äôs just not for me
2020,"@LongtermDM2020 I always respect the intellect of Samuel Langhorne Clemens.
However, I'm not in accord with this "".
After decades of a plant-based diet, abstinence from junk food/beverages, regular exercise, no addictions, @ the age of 65+ I'm : 5'9"" 150#s 32"" waist &amp; likely will reach 100&lt;.

2020,@TheRoSho Plant based isn't really worth it unless you're just vegan. A lot of plant based food replacements are still horribly over processed. Meat eating isn't bad per say. It's the origin and intake that make a big difference...
