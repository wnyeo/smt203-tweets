2020,@sciencegeist @STEMxicanEd @Chemjobber The Gray lab team are the best in that domain indeed! I bet that the specifics of the cooking process and the other components of the Impossible Foods plant-based meat have huge impacts on the precise chemical form of the heme.
2020,"@sciencegeist @STEMxicanEd @Chemjobber My favorite thing about Impossible Foods plant-based “meat”  - because of the heme, it is an ideal source of nutritional iron, just like muscle meat. Heme is the most readily assimilated source of iron."
2020,"@sciencegeist @STEMxicanEd @Chemjobber Heme protein chemist here, and fan of Impossible Foods approach. No, heme is not a protein. Heme in the Impossible plant-based meat is Fe protoporhyrin IX, more technically known as heme b. It’s the most widely occurring of the iron porphyrins in organisms."
2020,Stop eating meat substitutes. If you want a real plant based burger make one with mushrooms and lentils. Look up the recipe. Stop eating these sodium burgers from grocery stores and fast food spots.
