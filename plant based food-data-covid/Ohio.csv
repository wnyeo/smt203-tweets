2021,@terrydresbach2 No apologies here. I love butter. I love it on my food and in my baking. It is a natural product. I lived through the margarine versus butter debate. Now there will be a new debate on plant based. Long live BUTTER! (from a cow)
2021,"@BobVGann @Lloydi_COYS @ft_content @Tesco Actual plants are better not plant based made in a lab food.
Actual real meat and veg is best. Anything that has been processed and had ""stuff"" added isnt going to be good for us.
You even said processed food was bad with stuff added in. Now you're arguing they arent 🤷‍♂️🙈🤡"

2021,"@Abefrotheking @Chubby94495852 @deaflibertarian So if there is no difference in taste ( more or less) and there’s evidence they are more or less as unhealthy as one another, there’s no reason to not eat the plant based stuff, if you’re not a person who hunts or like farms cattle for food which most people aren’t"
2021,"I love being a vegetarian! I always get asked what's my favorite food to eat and some of my friends ask me what's my favorite brand of vegan/ plant based food I love eating!
If you have any vegetarian questions for me, Ask Away! 🙂😊 https://t.co/s2PAVZAFyZ"
2021,@WillisFromTheYo @_blue42 He’s definitely not plant based 😂😂😂😂 but his food is!!!! 🤣
2021,"@_blue42 @AStavrinos The whole “healthier” aspect is its lack of cholesterol. But that’s not the whole story. Generally it’s not a good idea to eat highly processed foods, plant or animal based"
2021,Mikey be eating plant based food with me lol
2021,The ability to zip through emotions is mine. Getting anxiety over whether or not a certain food is actually vegan (as opposed to just plant based) or euphoria when something I cook gets the clean plate seal of approval from a non-vegan https://t.co/hFVOzEwjDX
2021,I vote that this response be used as the default response to anyone who claims that plant based foods are sourced unethically. https://t.co/S9gElDPlFR

2021,@FeralCosmonaut @TheTrueCompton I’m a bit past where the curve measures... I’m at the “cooking plant-based food for non-vegans” stage
2021,"@vegan_front I’m in a relationship with someone like that ^_^
He’s said out loud that plant based is a world-wide eventuality, and he’s enjoyed everything I’ve made for him. He still thinks “vegan” = expensive though because of processed plant based foods, but we’re getting there."
2021,"@RationalMomma @holmanm Also, check out Dr. John McDougall. He has some wonderful lectures about how you can reverse autoimmune diseases by adopting a whole food plant based diet. Amazing stuff!!!

2021,"@love_kimhyesoo @moozoogabba @notababycow The vast majority of white vegans are encouraging and attempting to do what they can to reduce all harm done, it’s white non-vegans who say vegan = privilege because all they know about eating plant based is the $9 cheese they see at Whole Foods."
2021,"@KatieKat13x It is a conscious decision to call plant based stuff by their name rather than “fake” whatever-it-is. I’ve started labeling my plant based replacement foods by their package name, like fishless filets, smart dogs, or veggie sausage"

2020,"@vorganicpotato @asphodelmoon @nokilinganimals @mellthevegan Vegetarians are why there is milk and eggs in everything, including stuff labeled “plant based”. And also why I have to explain to every person who handles food at whatever restaurant that butter and cheese aren’t vegan...."
2020,"@peta I prefer both meat and plant based foods. So, I'm both vegan and non-vegan. I like broccoli as much as I do a steak. Also, plants are living organisms too. So, really you are killing both animal and plants at the same time if you think about it. Both contain cells."
2020,@DanRather Thanks for all of your important messages and calm messaging! I shared this post this week also. #plantbasedfood
2020,"@lnole @MerrySzymczak I'd venture to say most people in the US have the ability to make that choice, it's just sad that we are culturally conditioned to eat animals from almost birth.  I'm just glad the options, availability, and awareness around plant based foods has increased."
2020,"Protein globalization WILL stop at some point. Look back at Mad Cows disease in the UK. Expect that you will be required in every nation.

There will be protein shortages.

Plant based protein is LABOR INTENSIVE during a human global pandemic therefore FOOD SHORTAGES happen"

2020,@ShadowManNerd @kevinnbass It's my understanding that low carb diets are potentially very unhealthy. Plant based whole foods are hardly inflammatory.

2020,@egoltz Based on what I’ve researched and others I’ve talked to I believe a Whole Foods/ plant based diet is healthier for longterm health success than longterm keto diets. Even keto dietitians admit there are concerns with certain aspects of the diet.
