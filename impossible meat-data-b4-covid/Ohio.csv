2019,BK tries to do something good for the environment by creating the Impossible Whopper &amp; some asshat sues them because allegedly the non meat burger may have been cooked on the same grill as the meat burger? @POTUS must have done it. Let's include this in the Impeachment Hearings.
2019,"Looking through the trending news stories on here and I see that Burger King is being sued for cooking Impossible Whoppers with meat.
I may not be the smartest person but I'm not going to a place that built its rep on cooking beef for a vegan option."
2019,Everyone go watch the episode of explained on Netflix about the future of mock meat and they explain the science beyond burger and impossible burger! So educating to learn about how plant food can taste like animal food :)
2019,"All of the ""impossible burger"" and plant based ""meat"" commercials have collectively decided a guy with a cowboy hat on is the authority on the matter of if it tastes like meat or not. ü§†üçî"
2019,"Every time I see an Impossible Burger commercial, I wonder why someone who doesn‚Äôt eat meat would want to eat something that TASTES like meat...? https://t.co/dCEAW1INEB"

2019,@amyythevegan Ive been vegan since may of 2019 and because the animals and the planet is important. I was very aware of the effects of meat when i was eating it but living with my parents it made it impossible. I dont live with them anymore and ive never been happier!

2019,"@seriouslyclara I‚Äôve been vegetarian for 10 years now and the beyond meat stuff tastes so weird to me, but Impossible burgers cooked like a real damn burger with cheese sauce good bun (Cheesecake Factory surprisingly was amazing) are amazing. Ex Carnivore checking in"

2019,Impossible Meat and Morning Star Farm stuff just hits different. In a good way.
2019,@_JSinay_  just devoured an impossible whopper without knowing it wasn‚Äôt meat and his reaction was priceless
2019,@RenovatingSuz I‚Äôd be interested in tryingrf the beyond meat ones. I enjoy the impossible burger at least the White Castle one. The whopper I had was over cooked but I‚Äôll probably try it again
2019,Wants to be meat substitute free in August.... Burger King finally has the impossible whopper every where.....
2019,"@pt Impossible Burger vs Beyond Meat is a nice natural experiment. There‚Äôs something for the ‚Äúgo public sooner‚Äù crowd, and something for the stay private longer crowd. @paulg"
2019,@rdellon @rtravenick @ChuckWendig Yes. Vegans and people turned off by meat were already not going to be into Beyond or Impossible.
2019,"I‚Äôm fascinated by how quickly ppl have become evangelicals for the Impossible Burger. Not only that, but ppl now go out of their way to mention how they don‚Äôt like the Beyond Meat Burger.

You know what nobody talks about anymore? Black bean burgers‚Ä¶ quorn‚Ä¶ Morningstar"
2019,Saturday June 8 - Business Insider Select:       Impossible Foods' and Beyond Meat's plant-based burgers aren't actually healthier than the fast-food originals      Via @businessinsider        https://t.co/bxmY4ZMBLT https://t.co/dM7zwzbmcG
2019,"I don‚Äôt eat beef burgers anymore. Just the Impossible (or, as a second choice, Beyond) burger. I can tell a difference, but I actually prefer the taste, and no bloated feeling of too much red meat. Biggest bonus: for those of us who are environment- or animal-conscious, no guilt. https://t.co/41QX6w4Wl9"

2019,"@stonecold2050 His stupidity is so big when he said anyone who asks for political asylum should do it from their country. Sir  that‚Äôs impossible to do from a country you are trying to flee, you do that you and your family are dead meat. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called political asylum. Stupidity 101."

2018,@WhiteCastle @ImpossibleFoods You have customers coming in that Have never been into a white castle before because they are not meat eaters. If you get rid of the impossible sliders you will lose new customers and that includes myself. Please keep it.

2018,I tried the Impossible Burger. It was made by neuroscientists to mimic the taste and texture of meat. It has a molecule in it called ‚Äúheme‚Äù that is the same as what makes cow meat red and bloody. It tastes like....a burger. It‚Äôs not. https://t.co/dzyD7t5WKY
