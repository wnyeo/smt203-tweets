2019,Trying to buy for my parents is next to impossible. They are simple people and aren’t picky. They like to grill so I ordered them a nice package from Omaha Steaks. So I hope they aren’t like. “Oh. Meat. Ok.” 😂🤷🏻‍♀️🥩
2019,"i can &amp; cant believe BK is getting sued bc of their impossible whopper being grilled on the same grill as the nasty cow meat, like yeah but at least they offer something for vegetarians/vegans! cant be satisfied for shit 😒"
2019,"Customer : can I have a impossible burger 
Employee : sure let me just broil it on the same grill we put the meat one second please

2019,@MaraDavis Did you see this last night? They were throwing so much shade at that Impossible Whopper (and plant-based meat in particular)! https://t.co/MnYrTUKP2H
2019,"Thought it was have it my way 
@BurgerKing 🤔. I Ask they substitute the impossible patty on my toddlers whopper Junior, because she does not eat meat, the lady told me no 😳. And then I told her I will pay extra and she told me that wasn’t possible (no pun intended)"
2019,@TheRoSho it taste like meat tbh 😂 but ofc it’s not meat .. it’s impossible literally
2019,I'll be trying the impossible burger this weekend. Why? Because I have coupons for two free ones. Will I be switching to fake meat? No!
2019,just ate an impossible burger for the first time and it tasted so much like meat I was scared to eat it lmao
2019,"I’ve done the impossible. I got my husband to eat a vegetarian meal. No meat at all, AND  he is willing to try more!"
2019,I thought most people became Vegans partly to avoid the scientific manipulation of meat yet yall  will gladly accept the scientific manipulation of vegetables in order to simulate meat.  Trust me. Turning Soy into a chicken breast is Frankenstein level shit. #vegan #impossible
2019,Dat impossible whopper at burger king taste better than da meat. I'm sold
2019,"I had an impossible burger from @BurgerKing .....im a vegetarian so I had it thrown in the microwave vs on the grill where meat has been.... Wasn't too impressed but don't let that stop you all
#eating"
2019,y’all all excited about impossible meat like taco bell’s beef hasn’t been 75% sand since 2009
2019,So I tried the impossible burger from @BurgerKing . It was good! I haven't ate meat and especially a burger in over 16 yrs. So honestly can't compare it to a real one. I wouldnt get another one just cause sure its cooked on same equipment as those animal products 😣. https://t.co/jOTXKnpm53
2019,"hey @tacobell pick up impossible meat, I will spend 5x more money there if so"
2019,"I finally tried an impossible burger at @Wahlburgers in Atlanta - You couldn't tell it wasn't meat 🤔 what was it 😗? The burger was actually good but wasn't feeling the after taste. I think it was the grilled onions, I am not a fan of grilled onions unless it's onion rings."
2019,I love that soo many restaurants are serving alternative “beef” now! Love my beyond meat and impossible burgs

2019,"I would definitely call myself a meat eater, but the impossible burger @BurgerKing is honestly the best “burger” I have ever consumed."

2019,The Impossible meat shortage has me looking at cows again. 👀
2019,So I had an Impossible Burger yesterday and I’m still convinced that shit is meat.
2019,".@Publix...I think we need to breakup. Your meat program and product selection have become so inconsistent across your Atlanta locations, it makes it impossible to avoid going to multiple stores. But you do have ready to make chicken with cornbread so #yayme. #disappointed"
2019,@ReignBeaux_Lux It’s a plant based burger. They actually taste like a meat burger. Which is what is impossible
2019,Trying to see what the hell they putting in that impossible burger. I’ve been here 5x in less than a month.  I’m convinced they’re using real meat at this point. https://t.co/76aueVd3p5
2019,more pizzaaaaa!!  #impossiblemeat https://t.co/GKTQtAoN7l
2019,@ImpossibleFoods I hope that Impossible Food #WhatWillYouCreate is not using HEK 293 in their meat. Can anybody can confirm?
2019,"@TrillMD_ The patty they use is from a company called impossible foods. They make other products like a brick of the “meat” that you can use to make tacos, lasagna, etc. They’re supposed to start selling in stores this year."
2018,"Who’s tried Impossible Burger or similar products? How were they, REALLY? Thinking about reducing meat consumption because of the climate impact."

2018,"Real talk here: if you’re a meat eater, and you’ve tried the Impossible Burger, is it REALLY an equal substitute? I mean REALLY? I want it to be true, but I’ve been disappointed by 95% of plant-based “replacement foods.”"

2018,We need to move from “user” centered to “bag-of-meat-bones-and-instincts” centered. We’ve created a network of things that is impossible for our caveman brains to understand. #WIAD18
