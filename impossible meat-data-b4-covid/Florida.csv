2019,"🤣🤣 with that damn #raccoon 🦝 meat. that’s why that big impossible, yeah impossible to find in store ‼️🤣 https://t.co/WmrotovvW6"
2019,"@didlix Yeah, the Impossible Burger. It was quite delicious, although the cheese wasn’t great it went well with the rest of the burger. Closest approximation for the “meat” would be a cheap frozen burger, but tbh if I didn’t know it wasn’t “real” meat I wouldn’t have been able to tell."
2019,Has anyone tried the impossible whopper? Plant based. No actual meat.

2019,@GFORCEMONKEY78 @CNET Whole Foods doesn’t carry Impossible brand. Only restaurants do at this time. Maybe you had a Beyond Meat burger?
2019,"Impossible_foods has currently raised more than $750M and sits at a $2B valuation. Their main competitor, Beyond Meat, has had one of the most successful IPO launches of 2019 so far, Impossible will not miss the train of the growing success and demand for meatless alternatives. https://t.co/ssj070WFLZ"
2019,"Impossible Whopper at Burger King — ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
The Whopper was my favorite burger as a kid, and in high school I worked at the BK Lounge. But when I gave up meat six years ago, I had to say goodbye to BK.

2019,"They aren't made from vegetables but from plants, and therefore are not veggie burgers but, like they said, plant burgers. Also, vegans already eat impossible burgers rather than meat, don't you think it's more important for them to appeal to the larger, meat eating audience? https://t.co/z3PueyNlnz"
2019,"I had a Beyond Burger from Beyond Meat today for lunch. Had an Impossible Burger on Sunday for my birthday. The Impossible Burger was more like a real burger. Beyond was less like a real burger, but better than a “veggie” burger. Very good. Science! https://t.co/TXqtphIcl7"
