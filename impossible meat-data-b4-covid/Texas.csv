2019,"@TaylorLorenz The “meat substitute” language is often a way of explaining to novices a notion of what they’re going to get. And we would prefer that more people ate “gross” impossible burgers than beef ones, right?"
2019,"@61Tminter @Tazz602 @ankh1799 You can make a kick-ass bowl of chili with seitan crumbles and I dare ANYBODY to come for my Texan card now I’ve said so (I haven’t yet tried that Impossible meat stuff, have y’all?)"
2019,@timthaboi I am not vegan or vegetarian either but I prefer impossible WAY more than the beyond! Beyond smells like cat food. Impossible is actually passible as “ok” meat!
2019,@godvfwine YES. its so annoying!!!! $15 just bc my burger as impossible/beyond meat ok
2019,@ImpossibleFoods hi can you please bring impossible meat to stores in Austin Texas? I’m dying for it please I’m beginning you now pls or ship me a case?? Please thanks very much I love you
2019,Chef Jimmy made veggie chili with Impossible Burger “meat” today!  It will be ready at 1:00. Come warm up with a bowl. @ Sweetwater Grill and Tavern https://t.co/WzkVviFoPn
2019,@KingsAmbitions 😂😂 the real whopper is fake meat.. I can only imagine what the impossible is..
2019,"@LolitaKGmc @Gina_DiVito @theveganparent I had to live in one of the poorest districts in NYC. Finding ANYTHING VEGAN LET ALONE EDIBLE PRODUCE IS IMPOSSIBLE!  So i fucking feel this.  
AND IM LATINO AND MOST OF OUR FOOD ARE MEAT HEAVY SO.  I guess my struggle means Its not enough since she did it just fine."
2019,Correct: Plant based burgers like the beyond meat or impossible burger don’t release the methane that cows do!
2019,I wanna try that impossible whopper from @BurgerKing but I’m convinced it  won’t taste like meat even tho that’s what everybody keep saying lol
2019,This impossible burger from Burger King got me in fear that I’m eating beef after all these years of not eating red meat lol shit taste like a real whopper
2019,@TimBond1972 I don’t think Impossible has hit the UK yet. Tesco sell the beyond meat burger which is a close second but this was honestly just perfect. 👌
2019,"I’m rating the Impossible Burger 10/10.

This👇 is not meat. Terrific.

2019,@RealMattCouch Isn't this just Mac's answer to the BK vegan Impossible burger? Both will fail. Doesnt matter WHAT the Dems tell us about eating meat and cow flatulence.
2019,@specksofdani Beyond meat does that to me too. Impossible is better in my opinion
2019,"I ORDER A BURGER IT BETTER BE BEEF

2019,The impossible whopper @BurgerKing legit tastes like real meat! 🤯
2019,"@PapaPersian @accountable_gov @PeteButtigieg He knows you don’t have to limit your meat consumption. The markets are already moving to make sure meat has better competition (Impossible Burger, Beyond Meat, etc.)."
2019,@pamcho3 I have. I had an Impossible Whopper and one Impossible Burger at another local burger place. I liked them. I could not tell the Whopper from a meat one.
2019,I’ve had the impossible meat before but the Burger King whopper really made me question if they got my order right it was so good
2019,"Just saw a commercial advertising dog food with real meat in it then immediately followed by one for the impossible whopper @BurgerKing , a meatless burger. What a time to be alive."
2019,"Mushrooms are one of the most versatile foods around! Unlike meat and vegetables, mushrooms continue to break down as they’re cooked meaning it’s almost impossible to mess them up (unless you burn them!) Put them on a salad, a sandwich, a nice hunk of meat, or even in a stew!!! https://t.co/Nz1G28ipO0"
2019,"@___madtwatter Earth burger! 
But also, Burger King just got the impossible patty and Carl’s Jr. has beyond meat patty!"
2019,I just ate the “Impossible whopper”... you cannot tell it’s not meat and I loved it🍔Would I get it again nah cuz it’s expensive and I don’t like eating fast food but it was greatt:)
2019,Hopdoddy has the impossible meat patty ❤️🥺✨
2019,"Impossible burgers that are said to be vegan were tested on rats. Have a higher fat content than meat and have other ingredients that aren’t as healthy as we thought. 
https://t.co/SfP3yTCuSx"
2019,"I got the Impossible Whopper.

I poked at it for ten minutes before I had the courage to try it. It looked like a regular burger patty and I wasn't convinced. 
Finally, after my fiance insisted that he, a meat eater, could tell the difference I ate it. 

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Will buy again"
2019,Check Buger King new “Impossible Hamburger” from Texas used goodle has GMO in them . Of course before cow meat. We raise out own.
2019,"@retorgeson I will continue to eat meat, but when an impossible burger is on the menu, I’ll eat it.

I agree with you that shaming people into eating it isn’t the solution. Making it delicious and indistinguishable from meat, however, will.

And, once scaled, it will be cheaper than meat."
2019,@rinsanraman Is there a name for someone who still eats meat but wants to avoid it whenever substitutes (like impossible foods) are available?
2019,@Dave_B_NY Love impossible meat
2019,"""The impossible whopper is a solid option for meat eaters""

Ok but, why would I buy that when I could buy a real Whopper? Same price, still 630 calories instead of 660? Why would meat eaters choose that instead lol"
2019,"Plate full of vegetables (and cheese)! It was fun getting to try the fake-meat Beyond burger at home, but I think I still prefer the Impossible Burger at this point. https://t.co/ARcvBDsOJZ"
2019,"Burger King has an impossible Burger, huh? 
Good for them. It should do well considering their experience with faux meat infused with smoke flavor all these years."
2019,guys i tried the impossible burger today and it is IMPOSSIBLE that that shit is fake meat like she SLAPPT anyways now i gotta stop talking shit about Burger King
2019,They have impossible meat at Burger King! :O
2019,I don’t understand why impossible and beyond get so up in arms about people saying they’re not meat
2019,"@myssvegan order the Carl’s Jr. one extra crispy and it’s amazing.
I’d say the impossible burger tastes like Wendy’s burger because I still remember how meat used to taste lol"
2019,"BK made such a big deal w/ Impossible to stock it in all their restaurants &amp; appeal to vegans only to say, “it’s here! We have it! It’s not actually vegan bc we roll it around in meat juice &amp; slap a whole fist full of mayo on it! Come and get it!” Like, okay?"
2019,@24pnut24 Try impossible meat or beyond meat burgers as a beef substitute. Beyond meat burgers literally don’t taste any different.
2019,@Impossible_JoJo Chile that thang bout to be meat spread!!!
2019,"OMG!!! vegan foods are evolving. I just had this incredible bowl at @qdoba.

2019,What’s the Difference Between Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat? @Thrillist https://t.co/6Wuc7geqD2
2019,@abecho00 @tvelajr Lol. I’ll try it. But I haven’t had a good veggie burger ever. Beyond meat and impossible meat are the closest things I’ve had that I enjoyed.
2019,So Burger King is introducing the Impossible Burger (a completely plant based alternative to real meat) by the end of 2019 and I really see this as our future.
2019,"@Acceberrolyat @GOP There is a LOT we don’t know is in our food. And, yep, soy is in meat. Heck, these days, soy IS meat. Have you had an Impossible Burger, yet?"

2019,@MIZHANI_intl How was it ? Cause impossible meat is nasty to me...
2019,"@eliaskyo If these substitutes wind up cheaper than beef, it won’t be a fad. 

I love meat. Had my first Impossible Burger this week. I’m going to eat it at every opportunity now."
2019,"@SturgeonUX I thought about the Impossible Burger Menu and Beyond Meat Burger Menu, and even tried the Black Bean Burger Menu, but I think I’m going to have to scrap all those and design the first Taco Menu."
2019,The Impossible Burger tastes so good I’m always afraid I’m eating an actual meat. Lmaooo and that would be a travesty 🤣🥴🤢
2019,"Reminder that agriculture &amp; livestock are major proponents of greenhouse gases. By substituting meat, we can make a huge difference in the environment.

2019,@jfish1963 I’ll have to try those too. Apparently Burger King is trialing impossible. So they could get big fast indistinguishable from real meat. Pricey though. $20 at Oakland airport.
2019,They also don’t have the normal veggie burger and only the Impossible Burger which FREAKS ME OUT because it tastes too much like what I think meat tastes like. I need my veggie burgers to taste like veggie burgers. The red inside gives me the willies.
2019,@LJtaughtMe Beyond meat brand has great meat subs and impossible burger (impossible can’t be purchased in grocery but you can occasionally find it at a restaurant and it’s very similar to beef)
2019,"@pOtatoesrlyfe @jessithevegan @Kailaxvx @jordxvx Impossible says it's not vegan! 

If people want to actually be vegan why don't they buy a burger that is vegan?

This burger is for meat eaters."
2019,"@pOtatoesrlyfe @jessithevegan @Kailaxvx @jordxvx I said I didn't have it handy, I'm on my phone, but I've seen multiple statements. 

I suggest people message Impossible if they have questions, rather than relying on third party sources.

Again, I'm not saying it's not a good product. Pick it over meat.

But I like rats."
