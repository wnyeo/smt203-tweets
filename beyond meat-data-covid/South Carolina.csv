2021,"@karenaspwriter @MeatlessMonday Well said! @MeatlessMonday unites communities around a common, tasty good! Let‚Äôs all boil some water, break out the whole wheat pasta, brown @ImpossibleFoods or @BeyondMeat add red sauce and do a whole lot of good!üçù üç∑"
2021,"@Snuggles_32 @mellylyfe Yes, there should be more. Fast food: A&amp;W,beyond meat. MacDonalds sometimes has vegan wraps. Most pizza chains have vegan choices. Other: lots of options in Indian restaurants,Chinese ones. Caribbean: potato roti,and other meals. It is getting better. Expensive ones not so much."
2021,"@mellylyfe @Berlidge 100%! I‚Äôm neither vegetarian nor vegan (yet), but eat vegan food often. I really love my vegan cheddar cheese and cream cheese! Beyond meat products have gotten really good as well. Now hoping the price will go down a bit. Always order vegan pizza or vegan Indian food &amp; others."
2021,"@zerohedge Imitation meat is pointless. Enjoy meat if you want to. Otherwise, just think up great veggie recipes that don't have to pretend to be what they're not. IMHO Beyond Meat is just a con trick."
2021,"It's #MemorialDay and everyone around you wants to grill out but it's #meatlessmonday.   What do you do? 

Get a @beyondmeat burger of course.   Delicious.  üçî https://t.co/jDzqVb1VV6"
