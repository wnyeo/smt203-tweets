If I want a veggie burger I would pick Beyond, but if I want a real burger I wouldn’t consider that a viable substitute."

2021,@vegan_front @VegNews @BeyondMeat @McDonalds I love your opinion 😊 so many vegans are quick to poo poo on something because they won't eat it.  Instead they should take your stance and be happy that more people now have access to vegan options 😁

2020,@bgurley @MylesUdland @hblodget @skupor @arampell Some companies definitely get a marketing and perception boost from the pop. Beyond Meat did. Zoom did even before the pandemic. Likewise Facebook was tarnished until they figured out mobile. We need to quantify that.
2020,@JoeGoodberry @BeyondMeat Are you going vegetarian or vegan?
2020,"@McDonnellABJ @cristineboyd It was just announced that Beyond Meat “co-created” the McPlant, which makes me more hopeful. I still hate the name and wish they would incorporate more of the recognizable Beyond branding - something like ‘Big Beyond Mac’ a la Impossible Whopper? But fingers crossed it’s tasty!"
2020,@dawgsandelfs @Hot_For_Food Ohhhh it is. Beyond meat and Turkey bacon. Total travesties.
2020,Absolutely agree with this! @BeyondMeat More #vegan meals! / Can Snoop Dogg Be A Vegan Activist When He’s Not Vegan? https://t.co/UxSVBKUNJO via @peacedumpling

2020,@LAHeffer23 @BeyondMeat Man that sounds incredible. I’m going to give that a shot next week.
2020,"@TanyssEvans @BeyondMeat Love beans! I like chickpeas a lot with Indian/Mediterranean too, and that was before trying to eat sans meat. Thank you!"
2020,@joshelman Zoom and beyond meat definitely got a marketing boost from the ipo pop.
2020,"@b_bosse @BeyondMeat I agree so far. Especially in a lot of restaurants. I eat a lot of chickpeas, potatoes, &amp; beans at home."
2020,@tdegroff @BeyondMeat The guy from Game Changers! Thanks Tammy. 😊
2020,"@CWilson225 @BeyondMeat Sounds like a quality lunch I need to try out.

2020,"So after my transplant, I’ve been trying to lean more vegetarian. I just had my first @BeyondMeat burger and that thing was WILD. How’d y’all do that?!

Do any of you eat meatless when you can? What do you eat?"

2020,"If the company has a good brand and provides a good service, the stock is only going to go up. Might have some dips but long term it’ll be up. BeyondMeat, Zoom, and Datadog have been the 3 recent companies I bought stock at IPO in last year and I’m doing pretty solid right now."
2020,"I trade a lot but my position in Zoom, Shopify, and Beyond Meat is now a long term capital gain for tax. 🥰 So that’s what I’ve been doing wrong all of these years!"
2020,"You all realize everything started going downhill when they started producing this beyond meat crap, right?"
2020,"@bgurley That said, I do think the IPO process was a marketing windfall for Beyond Meat and Zoom. It actually added to the value of the brand (intangible asset)."
