2021,"@ranig @WR4NYGov @BeyondMeat Speaking strictly for myself and my family, we used to think In-and-Out was the best, but now it's the Impossible Whopper and we have Beyond Meat in the freezer. I cannot distinguish between the two. We're omnivores, BTW, and eat what we like."
2021,"If we're going to discuss a ""sin tax"" we better start with ultra-processed man-made crap like @BeyondMeat @ImpossibleFoods @Hostess_Snacks @Fritolay @CocaCola @Unilever etc. Demonizing REAL food is only about money, NOT #healthandwellness. #eatrealfood #activeeveryday https://t.co/OkUslzwgeW"

2021,"@fullsendste @bpiatt @jengates @tednaiman @BeyondMeat Countless n=1 results from those who have ditched fake food &amp; carb-heavy &amp; oxalative veg for #animalbased diets would say otherwise. Eat what you want, but optimal health cannot be obtained without meat."
