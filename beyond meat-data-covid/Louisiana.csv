2021,"אולי לא כל כך חברת צמיחה? Beyond Meat $BYND צונחת לאחר אזהרת הכנסות לרבעון השלישי ממגוון סיבות כהגדרתה. למרות, שכל זה בעיני לא רלוונטי. העסק הפסדי, והמוצר יהיה קומודיטי.

2021,Lady at pita pit (knowing I’m vegan) asked me if it’s okay if she puts real meat on the grill while my beyond meat is on there (far away of course) and I might cry that’s the nicest thing any food worker has ever done. Bout to leave the fattest google review

2020,"I’m not being a conspiracy theorist here, Beyond Meat is a multi-million dollar company and they make plant-based “meat.” Based on what I’ve read about the lab grown crap there is some serious backing for it. https://t.co/6XlvC6mvsB"

2020,"My mom: what are you doing for dinner?
Me: gonna start a revolution.

(I air fried a beyond meat patty and some onion rings and combined those two joints with cheese and pickles on an onion bun)"
2020,"@rjallain @MarkRober @BeyondMeat @ImpossibleFoods The fact industries use nuance i  language as rent-seeking to prevent competition and new businesses through legislation of what can be called what (Pringles are not chips/crisps, velveta is not cheese) makes me want it as close to competitors as possible."
2020,"@rjallain @MarkRober @BeyondMeat @ImpossibleFoods On a side note I love @BeyondMeat burgers. They pose some learning curve to cooking and are not as tolerant as meat to bad cooking. But likely could save my life if I could find them in town, no problem eating them as a burger over beef and I don’t give up beef easy."
2020,@rjallain @MarkRober @BeyondMeat @ImpossibleFoods I think they should be placed with the items they are designed to replace until the market has a large variety. Pretzels were mixed in with chips until they broke out with flavors. Now there is a pretzel only section on the chip isle.
2020,Hey @Starbucks show us vegetarians some @BeyondMeat love 💕 and add a real breakfast option for plant based patrons !!!💚
