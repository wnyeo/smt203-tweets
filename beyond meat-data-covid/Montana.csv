2020,@The_fezzz @herbieharry @BeyondMeat Yes. But most people don't actually get the proper nutrition from vegan diets as it requires more food to get the same amount of nutrients. Why most Herbivores spend most of there time eating.
2020,@herbieharry @BeyondMeat And humans are killed in much more violent ways every single day by thats right other humans
2020,@herbieharry @BeyondMeat Says you... just because you can't understand the plants dosent mean anything they are just the same as any other living creature... just because we say they aren't capable of something dosent make it true
2020,@The_fezzz @herbieharry @BeyondMeat Lol I mean God put animals on this planet to be eaten. Worn as clothing . Yes we figured out a way to produce enough to keep us alive.. but he told us to
2020,@herbieharry @BeyondMeat Lol yep.. your sites are very informative but here's the thing... you can find cancer links in most things people have in everyday life.. like a cellphone... even your oven. But hey its not like they don't have a cure to most cancers
2020,@herbieharry @BeyondMeat Baby cows are typically kept of the mother for a few weeks because the mother produces a very good milk for them when their firstborn. After that the mother produces more then the calf actually needs to live and can cause damage to the cow if not milked
2020,@herbieharry @BeyondMeat Yes AI is used but that's to protect the cows. Because they're too big to naturally reproduce on their own.  I did have take a few agriculture classes in college for my degree. I even took a few nutrition classes. But yes let's believe a news article you found..
2020,@BeyondMeat @resy Shouldn't call something meat that isn't
2020,"@herbieharry @BeyondMeat Plus your car, your house, your city you live cause more environmental damage then most farms.. animals have been breed to produce food to keep people alive...  cows actually can and will get sick if not milked."
2020,@herbieharry @BeyondMeat Its a plant...  and why have it taste like meat if your against meat... make zero sense.. and cruelty hmmm well i mean humans are more cruel to other humans and God* said in the Bible to eat what he provided for us.. and cancer risks are in everything.
