2021,"@Y_Soup One of my sons did this and wanted to try it for a week. We ate a lot of ""beyond meat"" at the Del Taco that week. It was rough. Thoughts and prayers brother"
2021,@WholeMarsBlog Beyond meat is going to do that. $BYND
2021,"might be a hot take buuutt
fake meat (i.e. impossible / beyond meat) is NOT healthier nor better for the planet. either eat a plant based diet or locally sourced humanely raised REAL meat if you’re going to preach about having a more environmentally friendly diet."

2020,"@HelgeKeck @techcafe @militanz @UKDanJones @MattStarling @kfalconspb @VascoFCosta @decassuncao @karlsterlund @mike_sec_eng @get_max @tonyffo I eat meat(low quantities due to high cholesterol)/chicken/fish/tofu/BeyondMeat(vegan)/dairy(in moderation, lactose intolerant)/eggs but NO ONIONS &amp; I consider myself gentle with our planet. It’s a balance thing. I admire vegan/vegetarian lifestyles. But not the only way."
2020,"@HelgeKeck I watched Food Inc years ago &amp; stopped eating beef/chicken altogether for a long time. I still eat, but way less. I tried Beyond Meat (vegan meat) in Moscow with @get_max @colonel_white &amp; loved it. I found Beyond Burger @ Costco in the US &amp; that’s my &amp; my son’s burger of choice"
2020,From a local supermarket here in Utah. This seems to suggest that the years-long effort to persuade Americans to substitute real meat with @BeyondMeat (&amp; other alternatives) in their dietary habits has not been too successful. https://t.co/mia9MWVQdH

2020,"Front &amp; center they call plant based barf burgers from @BeyondMeat served at @DennysDiner a “heathier” option for 2020. 🤪 Comparing it to the likes of Oat Milk (which is actually like other nut waters just oat water 🤫). BTW, Milk &amp; meat comes from animals. #bio101 #gocarnivore https://t.co/VnbqUi84rs"
