2021,@PandaExpress @BeyondMeat KC Metro would love this!
2021,@cryptosupcream @LinkFourthIR @vajolleratzii @BeyondMeat Meat is dead animal. Not denying that. It also tastes fucking delicious. Eggs aren’t chicks until they’re fertilized lmfao… I’m gonna block you now. Best of luck in being a true hypocrite.
2021,@cryptosupcream @LinkFourthIR @vajolleratzii @BeyondMeat You can call it “ice cream” or “milk” all you want. Keep eating that “burger” too. All in the sake of your tiny little brain feeling better about itself.
2021,@cryptosupcream @LinkFourthIR @vajolleratzii @BeyondMeat That’s not ice cream or milk lmao
2021,@cryptosupcream @LinkFourthIR @vajolleratzii @BeyondMeat I don’t think you know what vegan means if you’re eating ice cream homie

2021,I’ve been tweeting about fake chicken sandwiches for a while now. This is a big step in the right direction. Looking forward to seeing #PlantBased enter the chicken sandwich fast food wars. #QSR #BeyondMeat https://t.co/4PT92mIfnh

2021,Loving all of the @ontheborder promos they have this year but holy heck they are a meat-centric chain. Why again did they break up with @BeyondMeat? Major bummer. #PlantBased #Vegetarian

2021,I’m so excited to see @tacobell bringing back potatoes which were a vegetarian staple. When they killed them I lost interest in what remained. Also @BeyondMeat is coming! 🤩 #PlantBased https://t.co/45SrMCfTJz
2021,@laurenjpatton19 Yes I like beyond meat options. I have prepared them a number of different ways!
2021,"@LuraADye1 Oh yeah, that’ll get ya for sure. 🐝 Soy is amazingly in pretty much everything so I feel your pain! 😭For what it is worth, @BeyondMeat is soy free, they use pea protein instead. @JillianMarisa says beyond is too realistic."

2020,"@CanolaTrish @1GarethWynJones @BBCClick @BBCBreakfast @BeyondMeat @IKEAUK @GHGGuru @wheelersstock Such rich pigment! We have Red Angus here, too, although Blacks rule here near The American Angus Association HQ up in St. Joe. It must be the minerals in your grasslands. All that glacial scraping!"

2020,"Y’all if you haven’t tried @BeyondMeat burgers, you should. This is damn good."
2020,Too bad I had to block the crazy conservative before I could tell her that Tyson didn’t own 5% of Beyond Meat anymore 😆 that might have thrown her over the edge with her calling me ignorant and trying to educate me on how #Covid19 is spread and all.
2020,@BeyondMeat @CheerleaderPG Carryout Beyond Burger! #columbiamo #Mizzou
2020,"@boybandjunkie @musclesNmorsels @BeyondMeat @CertAngusBeef @ImpossibleFoods Indeed. Don’t make us change modes to get at answers. Especially after a RT from one of the products. SM 101, engage folks where they are"

2020,"I haven’t been to @ontheborder in years. After @solitarybrother mentioned they now have @BeyondMeat, we popped in to give ‘em a try. Yay #PlantBased endless tacos! Solidly impressed. Not an ad (LOL @ idea of someone paying me to tweet 😂) https://t.co/QwKV89R5UX"
