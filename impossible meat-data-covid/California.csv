2020,yo @BurgerKing 👏👏👏 ive tried the impossible whopper for a 3rd time &amp; it’s so bomb that i’m a lil paranoid that they’re just putting real meat on there 😂 but forreal as someone who likes meat but is moving towards being plant based for sustainability reasons... this is amazing
2020,Snaps for the @BurgerKing location that heard “can I have that with an impossible patty” and somehow assumed I meant I wanted an extra vegetarian patty on top of actual meat.

2020,"@nothingtoosee0 I say it's about time the cost of meat reflects the real cost of this environmentally unfriendly product. I have tried Beyond Meat &amp; Impossible burger &amp; they are absolutely delicious. Altho neither is ""cheap"" now, the goal of both companies is to make them cheaper than real meat."
2020,@rowlanmusic Counterpart definitely!! But then you also need to get the counterpart burrito (with impossible meat)

2020,"@Gennefer @jedijamesdean @PondRatanachai I consider impossible and beyond to be “tech-bro” meats. I studied at a plant based (but comprehensive animal product comparative) culinary school, so of course was immediately skeptical of the rise of Big Faux Meat. Lab meats are so far from “whole” foods, and misleading."
2020,@jedijamesdean @PondRatanachai @Gennefer Definitely does not make you a bad person! I eat meat and meat by products but as far as beyond/impossible vs meat goes I think there are better plant based options.
