2021,"@KassidyStrang @gayisg00d You make it impossible to discuss this. He was a he before the procedures, even she would say she used to have a male body. I was trying to formulate a sentence that wasn‚Äôt confusing which is literally impossible."
2021,@stone_skipping @chefdnel @FloribbeanSoul @Rinkytone @Strandjunker @OwlLove34 Don‚Äôt forget about impossible meat. And the billions he has paid in taxes selling Microsoft to fund all this.
2021,Impossible meat? More like possibly shit
2021,"@Abefrotheking @Chubby94495852 @deaflibertarian Yea well I think that‚Äôs sort of the idea, With impossible burgers. It‚Äôs like hey you burger eater, try this. And idk what foods you‚Äôre talking about that are different. Helllow meat eater can I interest you in celery? Is that what you mean?"

2021,"Tonight‚Äôs dinner is ‚Äúsh*t I had lying around‚Äù: impossible meat (because it was on a good sale and I bought 10 of them), barley, diced tomatoes, green beans, parsnips, corn, and spices to make it tasty üòã https://t.co/ifuaJn4Xnz"
2021,"@DeezNutzMayne @OhmyGaltx2 @Sweetemmilyn @T_Reps84 Honest questions are welcome but agenda-driven crap is just terrible. If you don't like me don't eat it move on to something else I personally don't like impossible burgers or beyond meat because of all the additives, but I would never discourage you from eating it. Live and Let"
2021,"Tonight‚Äôs dinner? A pasta bake with impossible meat, Aldi and Kroger brand vegan cheeses, and whole foods brand vegan Parmesan shreds. Homemade sauce, ofc. https://t.co/pgfYi06uxJ"
2021,"I have 1 dog that can sniff out any pill wrapped in cheese, meat, etc and will carefully eat around the medicine; nearly impossible to give pills. My other dog literally eats anything you hand her ü•¥ü§£"
2021,@TomoLovesNature I can smell the feces in it... like no joke. Animal meat smells like impossible meat with a strong overtone of ammonia and feces to me when it‚Äôs cooking
2021,"someone needs to tell fast food corps that they have to partner w just egg too, not just beyond and impossible meat"
2020,"@your_vegan You need to cover the glass container with aluminum foil so it doesn‚Äôt make a mess, but yeah. And the only way I could think to make the chili that expensive was to use 3 packs of impossible meat, lol"
2020,"@your_vegan 3 lbs of impossible meat, 4 cans each beans and 2 cans diced tomatoes, chili powder, garlic powder, black (or white, whatever you have) pepper, one small onion diced:
put impossible meat crumbled onto some aluminum foil and cook until brown, mix everything into a heat safe"
2020,"@McDonnellABJ @cristineboyd It was just announced that Beyond Meat ‚Äúco-created‚Äù the McPlant, which makes me more hopeful. I still hate the name and wish they would incorporate more of the recognizable Beyond branding - something like ‚ÄòBig Beyond Mac‚Äô a la Impossible Whopper? But fingers crossed it‚Äôs tasty!"
2020,@camijustice Nearly impossible to eat any kind of meat? Don't know where you came up with that one. Havent heard of anybody dying due to Covid infected meat. If you chose a vegetarian lifestyle. I must assume thats your choice.
2020,Bro the impossible ground beef is so good even if I ate meat I would eat this over cow
2020,"Bean based burgers &gt; imitation meat burgers. 
Although not a fan of them , I eat them occasionally. The impossible whopper inst bad. Highly processed though with lots of ingredients."
2020,I‚Äôm kind of against the pretend meat stuff but the impossible whoppers taste really good
2020,"Long term $BYND will fall back to $80-90. Planning PUTS which are later in the year. Meat packing plants reopening, so I expect some volatility. There's better competitors like Impossible Burger, too bad it's private."
2020,Agree although I‚Äôm not a big fan of impossible or beyond meat. Just eat a bean burger https://t.co/X8E4eS0kyB
2020,"Tried the impossible whopper. It's pretty close. I'll probably still buy the actual meat one, but meat alternatives seem to be getting better tasting"
