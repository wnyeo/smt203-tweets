2021,"Catholic church needs to change no meat Friday during lent. It is not a sacrifice to eat lobster, sea bass, calamari or shrimp pizza!  When i was young we couldnâ€™t touch the communion wafer, now can. If you can not change eat an Impossible whopper made from soybeans please?!?!"
2020,@theodramatist on the cross country trip the impossible/beyond/veggie meat winner is the White Castle Impossible Slider. Their Black Bean Veggie Burger is also good! Sadly none in SD.
