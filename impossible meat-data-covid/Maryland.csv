2021,"@WilliamMatt22 @hotfriendlyblk Better yet, Starbucks uses Impossible meat. 🔥"
2021,"@chrisecrowley Beyond meat and impossible meat also both work really well, I have substituted either for pork in many TWOL dishes."
2021,"@icbm999 @johnath16975885 @lightning__god @ladycookiebeski @MarinaMedvin I’m not saying we’re right. Most times we get it wrong. But what are we going to do? I’d love a food source that had flavor, texture &amp; nutrition. Beyond &amp; Impossible are a start, but we’re a long way away from feeding 9 billion people with alternatives to meat/fish."
2021,"@Hoodvidsdaily @detgrim @T4RIG Yes because the only alternative to meat is impossible burgers there is absolutely nothing else

Fucking dumbass"
2021,"Impossible Burgers are dreadful; concocted. Stick to burgers made from whole food ingredients.  Probably, even meat is safer. https://t.co/BS3eYRoH3J"
2021,"@FormerlyCBM Today, they won't. But as capitalism provides better and better alternatives to a steak, you will see them eventually surpass meat.

Burger King's Impossible Whopper &gt; standard McDonald's ""meat"" patty"
2021,One last time: Now one is saying an Impossible Burger is healthier than a cucumber. But saying veg burgers are as damaging to your body and the planet as meat is factually incorrect to a colossal degree. Cut it out.
2021,"Things that are next to impossible to prove: my suspicion that the checkout person at Harris Teeter forgot to put my meat in plastic in with the rest of my groceries, and thus I didn’t realize it until I unloaded everything at home."
2021,If beyond and impossible meat gives you indigestion but you love the meaty taste give these a try! @DrPraegers &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://t.co/soWyJZ5E7D
2021,@IDoTheThinking The only thing I’m concerned about is some of the Plant-based meat I like such as the Impossible &amp; Beyond Burgers aren’t all that healthier than red meat and they’re worse in some ways (sodium). Hopefully they keep improving over time.
2021,I’m not sure if I trust I was eating an impossible burger or if they screwed up and gave me meat 😅
2021,"@jerseymikes it’s be stellar if you all could jump on the Beyond Meat/Impossible bandwagon so that the vegetarians and vegans can enjoy a good sub. Meatballs, cold cuts, hot subs🙌🏽Hoagies n grinders and subs Oh my!😱👍🏽"
2021,@scottlincicome Best meat for people new to barbecue. Almost impossible to screw up unless you undercook it.
