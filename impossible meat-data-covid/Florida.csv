2021,At Burger King about to try the impossible whopper I really be over meat sometimes. If this jawn good then it’s about to be my new thing lol
2021,@jake_my_day Yes! It's impossible to have a bad mood when I listen♥️
2021,"The Burger King app is atrocious, put in my order as a Whopper vs Impossible and I accidentally had a bite of meat."
2021,"STOP SCROLLING!

For the rest of your life, all pizza you choose to eat is limited to one topping. You cannot remove the topping. There are no loopholes.

Your selection?

(If you don't eat meat, assume Impossible Anchovy exists.)"
2021,The Giants offense is impossible to watch. It’s like I’m watching scabs in a strike year. It’s just awful. #TogetherBlue
2021,"Call me old fashioned, but I prefer vegetarian to “plant based”. I’ve had a few “boca burgers” before, but this “plant based” fake meat stuff, no thank you.🤢🤮 I would rather eat a grilled portobello mushroom burger than that “impossible meat” stuff. Reminds me of #SoylentGreen."
2021,@sandoclicks Paccheri pasta 🍝 vodka sauce / impossible meat
2021,@zoocat @heightofidiocy @MikeThinksAloud This is pretty much 100% the way I view cultured meat. They use animal cell lines to grow “meat” in a lab. I don’t see Impossible Burger as much different either.
2021,One of my favorite festival pst times is to linger near the impossible booth and hear people discuss impossible meat. Some have a visceral reaction to non meat meat. https://t.co/N6KyCIK8xl
2021,"A solution in search of a problem. But I bet the meat industry is sending some sweet payola … er I mean “lobbying” to hopefully slow their growing competition. 

No one is accidentally buying impossible or beyond 🙄 https://t.co/H3LkMTGQcM"
2021,$Billion idea: a meat-based Impossible Salad!
2021,@DblockWWT @Kristennetten Beyond Impossible: The Next Tesla - Plant-Based Meat? https://t.co/TFYkHdNB3b
2021,"@David_Leavitt What is it with all this animal flesh
eating ? A Veggie Burger ! One of the burger fast food restaurants served it, (before the ""Impossible"" burger) instead of meat and people didn't know the difference !
The science makes this possible now !"
2020,@cryb4by____ A lot of the time I have people bring back impossible burgers bc they think it’s real. Or they throw up bc they think it’s real meat
2020,"@richardmarx @ImpossibleFoods I think it may be an Impossible Foods marketing strategy to get that gross rise from us folks. Once the ""meat"" quiets down it should be good to go. Who is squeezing it, Richard or the CEO? 😂"
2020,"I’m rating all the plant based meat options at fast food places. So far Dunkin’ has the best breakfast sandwich and I’d like the impossible whopper better if it was smaller. 
Today is Starbucks impossible breakfast sandwich."
2020,"Tried an impossible whopper today because I got it for free. 
As someone who just doesn't enjoy the taste of meat, it was actually super good and would order again."
2020,@BurgerKing on West Flagler and 33 Ave in Miami is problematic! Asked for double egg n double bacon on the plater 4 my sister (take a look at the picture) Asked for the impossible crossan’wich because i am vegan and they gave me real meat after confirming 3 times for impossible https://t.co/y5w7AbKk2Q
2020,"@PascoSheriff I think I may treat myself today to an impossible burger from @BurgerKing ! Delish &amp; great option for those of us who do not eat red meat‼️
🙌🏻🍔🍟🥤😊 https://t.co/0KK1ON63cB"
2020,Impossible Actual Meat Burger https://t.co/6BFBY4zuPt
2020,"Vegetarian Tacos are best Crunchy and Impossible - Seasoned Ground Meat Substitute, Shredded Cheese, Avocado, Lettuce, Pico de Gallo, Cilantro Cream, Fresh Jalapeños, Salsa and Lime onside.

Conveniently order… https://t.co/VSNjuMII3a"
2020,"@kimmieswatching LOL Kimmie ... you can still enjoy your meat burgers, but for those of us who do not eat meat is good news to have the impossible burger option ... I really like it! It’s tasty! 🍔💖😊 https://t.co/xmc50hQNFu"
2020,"@DBelleville14 I looove beyond burgers! They taste “meaty,” but not exactly like a beef burger patty. I’m a meat eater but eat these, too. I make them at home. I’ve heard impossible burgers are good too"
