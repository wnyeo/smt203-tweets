2021,@florbellez Is it impossible burger or another McDonald's based vegan burger? Personally I love impossible but I wouldn't be surprised if they just made a cheap replica of their already cheap burger meat üçî
2021,"Have y'all been to Veggie Grill? Cause that place is the bomb. Honestly, their veggie/Impossible Burgers are honestly better then meat burgers. God, I love them... Not mentioning that for any other reason.

On a different note, anyone remember Chappelle's ""beyond pussy"" joke?"
2021,"@GSmokesweed1 I had a brain scan b4 breakfast, then we had take out grilled German looking cheese sandwiches,on thick slices of artisan bread. Starbucks grilled cheese sandwiches are the best! Wife also had a coffee thingy, I sipped lemonade. We'll savor impossible meat Chili Mac for supper."

2021,"I've found that I am feeling better with less meat in my diet. A significant drop in inflammation and it's tricky keeping a protein-heavy diet without meat, but not impossible. https://t.co/L6uiyjdwDA"
2021,"So I use the impossible meat to make some impossible taco meat, and I tossed it in some spinach, home made salsa‚Ä¶. I didn‚Äôt hate it, more confused‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt have the same texture of ground beef, need to figure out how to harden it up"
2021,I told my coworker today that the last time i ate impossible meat my stomach fell through my butthole :(
2021,Impossible meat is a total lie. I just had my first one ever from @Starbucks and it was totally possible.
2021,@watermicrobe Have you tried it with some saut√©ed crimini mushrooms. It pairs really well with impossible meat esp in keema
