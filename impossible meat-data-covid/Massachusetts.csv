2021,"@baseballcrank It'll never replace a beef hamburger, but Impossible Burgers are pretty freakin good. But really the best meat for a burger is Bison so everyone's wrong anyway."
2021,"@jaimealyse Pickled corn relish and cilantro for topping. Have to brighten it. Brown sugar and cider vinegar. Also, uhhh, impossible meat."
2021,"@hrbrmstr it suuuuuucks, the mental strain especially. but hey i was able to cook lunch (pasta with ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù meat) so if it‚Äôs covid indeed thank god for for vaccinations ü§üüèΩ https://t.co/KKrrWfwahu"
2021,"For example we now frequently buy Beyond and sometimes Impossible faux meat products where in the past we would've usually bought cheaper stuff.

Now, not everybody is in our position. But I gotta think we're not alone."
2021,"Did you know that #impossible meat is now available in the Kennedy building? Try the smoky, plant-based goodness at the grill stations in Beatty Cafe and eat&gt;cafe!

2021,@gauravsabnis The good aspect is that McDonalds makes 10x better veggie patties for their burgers in India. Impossible will have to actually make it for people with a veggie diet and not for those who want the taste of meat but don‚Äôt want meat.
