2021,"@RealLouieBear @Ghazi90000 @saddle_maker @FirearmsRetro The same was said about pretty much any social movement. Maybe trying to stop it all within a year is impossible, but we're seeing substantial growth over the past 15 years, and meat alternatives like Impossible Burger is rapidly growing. It's about the long-run"
2021,@TheMetalGay1 @ben_rios82 @Ordinary1World Impossible meat tastes more like beef than any other plant-based meat. I know many people who have tried the one from Burger King and couldn't even tell the difference.
2021,"@DCCyclone @_Brett__ @agraybee Lab-grown meat is different from the stuff in the Impossible Burger, though. I can't be bothered to replace the meat in my diet with Impossible meat, since I don't care, but if it's lab-grown meat, then I can be bothered once it's cheaper than an actual carcass."
2021,I don’t trust impossible/beyond meat
2021,"Why is #ImpossibleMeat getting suggested when I type in ""organic beef""?

@Walmart this is NOT it. https://t.co/AyIQjitnhB"

2021,@SZAgold I LOVE in n out! I’ll do a grilled cheese animal style. I also do homemade double doubles with impossible meat 🤤
2021,@OldTownCourtney Impossible meat
2021,Fully cooked. Can supposedly do fresh chicken i just dont care for working with meat. Cannot have beef at all omg so much histamine. Impossible burger is heavy in soy which is heavy in histamine and makes me nauseated. I feel like I'm slowly starving 😩 I cry sometimes at meals
2021,"@robintran04 after watching his special, I'm willing to bet he did it as a means to ""bridge the divide."" Since it's clear any criticism of him really seems to take up space in his head. ""I can't be transphobic,I'm putting away money for a trans comics kid, I've sampled impossible meat tacos"""
2021,The other day I made spaghetti for my nephews with impossible meat and truffle oil… they didn’t know the difference. They just knew it was delicious 🍝
2021,"@TheSolarGazer @geostylegeo With these small txt exchanges, it's impossible to get to the meat of anyone's life. It takes years to truly know a person, so I really value my friends. We keep each other going &amp; drive each other nuts at times. But you'll be successful in life in more ways than you imagine."
2021,@Fadetoblack7575 @rawsalerts My favorite part was the Impossible Meat bit. Absolutely PERFECT 😂. Dave is the 🐐

2021,"The fact that there’s a $3.50 up charge for getting impossible burgers is hilarious

Josie and I have to pay $7 more because we don’t eat meat 😂"
2021,"@waltshaub B-meat is not the answer in &amp; of itself. It’s the first (impossible meat also) food innovation to replace the worlds insatiable need for unsustainable red meat production. Cultured meat, Regenerative farming pose much greater &amp; more sustainable solution to meet ppl where they are"
2021,"@Hey_Zeus09 Hey, I'm on a plant-based diet. Anytime I cook, and the recipe calls for meat. I use impossible meat as the substitute for ground beef. I tried a bunch of the plant-based meats. It was my favorite, It tastes the most like meat. Lol I'm good luck with your new lifestyle. 😁"
2021,@AllisoneTamez Man being vegan is fucking expensive have you seen the price for impossible meat like fuck that I’m just gonna eat a cow
2021,I might have to run that meal back with the impossible meat
2021,"“And while tech meat is a good source of protein—Impossible has 19 g. of protein in 4 oz., and Beyond has 20 g. of protein in 4 oz.—they lack many of the other nutrients found in minimally processed veggie burgers, such as fiber and a host of vitamins and minerals.” https://t.co/qw7C5JqCyx"
2021,“Glazed and confused” my favorite Easy Slider burger. But at home and made with impossible meat @ Larry's Downtown Breakfast and Brothel https://t.co/P5utHW6kBf
2021,@branrags I like the impossible brand more than the beyond one. Beyond tasted like fake meat. Impossible is pretty damn close to tasting like real meat.
2021,"Okay I’ll bite. I’ll try this new “impossible” patty on a English muffin at Starbucks. If it actually tastes like meat, I’ll change some of my carnivore ways."
2020,$14 for an impossible burger....... BITCH I WOULD NEVER (I'd eat real meat first)
2020,#turkeydam last night!  I haven’t eaten meat in almost 4 years.  So I got the impossible burger.  I had to make sure I wasn’t eating cow 😂😂😂 that mf’er was gooder than a bihhh https://t.co/5EdWvUfsSB

2020,Pizza Hut X Impossible Meat #GameChanger
2020,"@stopdeepin Eye can’t even eat meat anymore. Eye fee like recently eye was fed meat on purpose. They claimed to be an impossible burger but that had some death in it. My stomach hurt, my farts was toxic and eye felt heavy. Eye don’t even desire to eat much veganized foods just plant based."
2020,"“Impossible meat? more like impossible to devour” 

stfu before i tell you to put everything back"
2020,"I just wanted a taco for lunch today... not a damn street taco.. a taco with meat, cheese, lettuce, you know...a TACO? How is it impossible to get a regular taco in Austin Texas??? https://t.co/j6RIhOKy5O"
2020,"Tried a new twist on an old dish with @impossible_foods plant “meat” and @amyskitchen lentil soup. Super comfort food for a Sunday night. 💯 👌 Husband &amp; toddler approved.

2020,"@rachsaysbekind @centerof_ @alypod12 @charlottelhope Going any type of diet that exclude meat is impossible in my Asian ass household, we eat every part of beef"
2020,"Impossible Whopper is pretty good, once Whataburger gets on that fake meat game I'll eat there 50 times a day. Anyway here's a combination KFC/LJS https://t.co/k4g1bkDaZY"
2020,@PracticeHunger @SparkyGrinder @VinnieTortorich Earnest vegans who're experienced in the diet don't want impossible meats. It's a transition food for people who think the only way to get protein is to eat meat &amp; who can't figure out that viruses come from overcrowded meat factories—kinda makes carnivores like anti-maskers.
2020,"@lapulgasesina Use el saca puntas de vegetales, para la forma de fideos. Albondigas hechas de impossible meat y salsa. Bien fácil, lo sazonas como gustes."

And not telling anyone its impossible hamburger 🤣"
2020,"@teaptot @veganhippiesol Ugh. What a bummer. I mean... cool, more people get to eat impossible meat? 🤷🏻‍♀️ but the environmental impact is still horrible and cholesterol out the wazooo... not for vegans. 😔"
2020,"@raccoonometrics @AOCummies @Brrrrrpp Broke: Beyond/ impossible meat
Woke:Ground grasshopper paddies."
2020,Ya I’m gonna hard pass on this.  The larger problem is then overly processed foods. Those impossible burgers and beyond meat are so processed it’s not even funny. So I’ll stick with my eating of meat in general! https://t.co/OJIqGVGX9Q
2020,I have no choice but to buy beyond and impossible “meat” because that’s all my body will allow
2020,The texture &amp; taste is nearly identical to meat. I bought this 1lb. pack of #impossiblemeat at #Kroger. Try grilled! #impossibleburger #impossible #vegan #meat #plantbased #plantbaseddiet #vegetarian #vegetarianrecipes #burgers #food #foodie #mmm #yum #yummy #burger #cheeseburger https://t.co/nI41dfPfTp
2020,@ImpossibleFoods When are you selling your meat direct to customers? In Austin Texas and I really don’t have a good way to pick up impossible burgers in bulk?
2020,Tip - try Impossible Meat now.  It’s yummy and didn’t cost a family loved ones because South Dakota didn’t think it necessary to be proactive at their plants. https://t.co/WEmnecK2wn
2020,I still will ride for the Qdoba Mexican Eats impossible meat though if we were not under shelter in place I would simply drive to arlington to get Qdoba Mexican Eats and see the Dallas homies.
2020,"#cured #meat #sunday First attempt at some #dried #cured #salami &amp; #soppressata Now to wait...
Thank you meatnjesus for the 3rd and 4th hands as well as the fresh venison; otherwise an impossible task for one. @… https://t.co/LhSLp2gD4O"
2020,"@ne0liberal 1/2 
I still think the best reason is simple: if something that was sentient gets made into food, shouldn't it (at the very least) be good food? If I can hardly tell the difference between a Whopper and the Impossible burger, am I not obligated to forgo the meat?"
2020,"Impossible Shepherds’ Pie — it’s not just the lack of meat that makes it impossible, it’s also the lack of potatoes... ⁉️It might even be Keto-friendly for all I know 🤔 #ImpossibleShepherdsPie #KetoFriendly https://t.co/J3szSLjSFE"
2020,"But the advent of technology that enables non-meat products to taste more like meat than ever poses a fresh ethical question that’s particularly relevant this time of year: Can Catholics, in good conscience, eat plant-based meat substitutes like the Impossible Burger during Lent?"
2020,"@nerrad413 Right! Like the moment I turned 24, it just went downhill. I was physically fit and didn’t really change my diet at all. Then all of a sudden it starts. I missed meat at first, but thankfully Impossible has helped with any burger cravings I may get lol"
2020,Hey KC!! Go get the deal!! No impossible (fake) meat at this location! #Scouts #199thMetcalf https://t.co/6Q57M2wX53
2020,Best in KC area and none of that fake impossible meat here!! https://t.co/cSvxJRY0PO
2020,"@TRILLxxBILL Yeah that’s what I’ve heard. I had the impossible whopper today and it was good but I can’t buy that every single day. I’ve not gone without eating meat, so it’s going to be a challenge for me."
2020,@JetherBlaise @AJA_Cortes I don’t eat meat period as it is impossible to ride meat of blood which we are commanded not to consume. Kosher butchering does not remove the blood.
2020,"It also has more iron, much less fat, fewer calories, and no cholesterol. Along with the Impossible Sausage, the company is making a version of pork that can be used in any dish that typically uses ground meat, such as dumplings or spring rolls."
2020,The Impossible Whopper patty is made from 21 ingredients. The original whopper patty is made from 1.  Why eat fake meat from a factory when I can just eat part of the natures factory?
2020,"Damn @RolandB3 , daughter is on her vegetarian kick again so I bought her an impossible burger. It really does taste like meat! Not a big juicy patty of course, but better than what I used to eat"
