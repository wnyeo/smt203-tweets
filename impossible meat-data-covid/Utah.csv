Bonus points for some diced mushrooms to go along with it."

2021,"might be a hot take buuutt
fake meat (i.e. impossible / beyond meat) is NOT healthier nor better for the planet. either eat a plant based diet or locally sourced humanely raised REAL meat if you’re going to preach about having a more environmentally friendly diet."
