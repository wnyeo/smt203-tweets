2021,"@BriannaBinds It's tough to come up with dinners day after day with no meat, eggs or dairy. And impossible if you travel for work like I do to find vegan choices at restaurants, especially American chain restaurants.."
2021,"@notmuchelse One of my favorites is to do a jar of green curry with impossible meat (beef works too), onion, and peas served inside roasted acorn squash. It feels fancy but itâ€™s so easy."
2021,"@Emily_R_King Strong recommend for Impossible burger. I cook for a vegetarian &amp; two meat-eaters (&amp; myself, who can happily go either way as long as there's cheese &amp; yogurt.) Impossible burger is the *only* meat substitute that my carnivores actually like. Great for chili, meatballs, etc."
2021,"@andraydomise Find a way to meet the impossible demands he made like 5 tons of sea lion meat and freeing Willy or never show my mug in his water, again."
2021,@Reuters Beyond meat &amp; impossible have far too much sodium per serving. I was excited for the option until I read the Nutrition Facts labels.
2021,"@holykoolaid @mik3_mik3_mik3 We evolved as carnivores, so I have little guilt with eating meat.  But...
-Beef/pork production is bad for environment
-Cruelty to the animals has to stop
-I embrace the impossible burger and anxiously await vat grown meat."
2021,"Jamie Ager, fourth-generation farmer and CEO at Hickory Nut Gap, recently wrote a short, 2-min read titled ""Mission Possible"" â€“ it's not impossible to raise meat the right way. Check it out here: https://t.co/3YSOvw0PsH

2021,@Gcarmi21 I have a large bag of natural charcoal that I found either at Lowes or Costco. Stuff if impossible to light so I mix it with Kingsford. I also have wood chunks depending on the meat type.
2021,"@NachosSoSpicy Which do you prefer, Beyond or Impossible? As someone who really needs to cut out meat, but just can't bring myself to do it, because I don't really like vegetables, I need to find something to replace it."
2021,"@ncsujen @95KeepPounding All joking aside it was IMO bad journalism. They tested it at the point it has so many ingredients etc that it's impossible to get DNA and they acknowledged it

Albacore (Majority of white meat tuna) is very affordable.

Not saying I trust the preparation. But I trust it's tuna"
