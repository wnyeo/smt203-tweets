2021,"@MrJohnIsHappy @AdamRMG @ReutersFacts I don’t care for it a bit, the texture and taste are generally off-putting to me, but I do eat a lot of tofu (that’s not technically imitation meat, though). I particularly dislike the Impossible meats, but I appreciate their availability for others who enjoy them."
2021,"@awomanwhoeats Hi! Appreciated your pieces on Germantown restos, and also vegan-friendly places in Philly. Any advice on a vegan- and meat-eater friendly dine-out for Thanksgiving? Trying to do the impossible and please both tribes. 🙏 Thanks!"
2021,"Dear restaurant industry,

Stop making Impossible/Beyond ""meat"" a part of every vegetarian/vegan dish. Many of us who partake in these dietary modifications would rather not ""pretend"" to be eating real animal flesh. There are more creative options.

Love, 

James (#vegetarian)"
2021,The impossible vs beyond meat beef is serious 😭
