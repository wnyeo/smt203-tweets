2021,"Al ""climate change"" Gore, among other Democrats, is a big investor in @ImpossibleFoods.  So now the Democrats will push a less meat agenda to insure their cohorts make some cabbage.

2021,"@BeyondMeat is the superior vegan meat. Don’t get me wrong,I like impossible but beyond is hands down the best. If you disagree I don’t care."
2020,@ashlie_weeks Impossible fake meat sloppy joes. Portobello mushroom cheesesteak.
2020,"@AndBrazen I’m a vegetarian and I’ve have these. If you are a meat eater beyond burgers and impossible burgers are for you. They give me heartburn, but I think it’s because I’m used to bean and grain meat substitutes"
2020,"It can happen @TurnerSportsEJ. Tell Barkley if he eats, likes &amp; doesnt miss meat in this vegetarian meal, an Impossible Whopper from BK &amp; this Mediterranean Chickpea Salad, https://t.co/eCNBwIFV4I, he has to join Twitter.
